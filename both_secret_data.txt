me in no particular order:<\\/em><br \\/> 1) i am dutch-indonesian. i was born in holland raised in amsterdam.<br \\/> 2) my native tongue &amp; passport are both dutch.<br \\/> 3) i don't think i will ever give up my passport even though the dutch don't allow dual citizenship.<br \\/> 4) i moved to california before i turned 18 which is why i have never voted in my life.<br \\/> 5) my mother and i moved to the us to start a new life away from my father. my father is a bad man and by that i don't mean bad-ass. we chose the bay area because we picked a place on the map where neither one of us had been to before.<br \\/> 6) my mother moved back to holland 10 years ago. i have no blood-relatives here and sometimes this really freaks me out.<br \\/> 7) i went to 5 high schools in 2 countries over a period of 2 years &amp; graduated in 3 years at the age of 16.<br \\/> 8) i moved out when i was 16 to live with my boyfriend who was 9 years older. 3 1\\/2 years later at the age of 19 i moved back home not knowing what it was like to be single.<br \\/> 9) i have a 17 year younger brother. 17 years is exactly one generation. i want to get to know him.<br \\/> 10) my hair has been purple for 12 years.<br \\/> for most of my life i had very long dark thick hair. one day i tried to imagine myself without hair and i <em>couldn't<\\/em>: the thought of having it all gone was so frightening i had no other option but to shave it all off. when my hair grew back out i dyed it purple and it's been purple ever since.<br \\/> 11) i rode horses competitively for most of my life: showjumping.<br \\/> i had the most incredible grey thoroughbred gelding: woody. short for kirkwood [the mountain]. i won the junior grand national in 1990 and i actually went pro for one year. once in college i started to read too much philosophy &amp; i couldn't bear to put a bit in my horse's mouth any longer; i couldn't put a saddle on him anymore. i retired him &amp; haven't ridden since then.<br \\/> 12) i raced cars for one year: a 1982 black 911 porsche carrera 3.5 liter engine. whale tail. license plate: cujo35<br \\/> 13) i rode a <a class=\\\"ilink\\\" href= \\\"\\/interests?i=motorcycle\\\">motorcycle<\\/a> for 6 years. it was my only source of transportation during that time. and there was never a day that went by without a close call. i miss my bike a lot though &amp; still have plans to get another one.<br \\/> 14) i worked as a dom during my junior year in college. what began as a purely anthropological and intellectual endeavor really turned out to be a deeply emotional can of worms. the day this became clear i quit. i know that endeavors #12 13 and 14 were integral to my growth during those years. and by integral i mean that these things were a combination of symptom catharsis self-discovery healing and in retrospect they are each very metaphorical. so don't get too excited about this one ;-)<br \\/> 15) i graduated with a 3.95 from berkeley where i double-majored in english and dutch literature.<br \\/> 16) i worked as a teaching assistant for two years afterwards--i probably graded over 2000 papers during that time.<br \\/> 17) i received a full scholarship to pursue a phd in literature at berkeley but dropped out after 4 semesters. my decision to leave academia was one of the toughest choices i have ever had to make. i am glad i made that decision though as i feel that academia was too good of a hiding place for me (see #20).<br \\/> 18) it took me 28 years to discover the banana. i hated bananas for the first 28 years of my life.<br \\/> 19) i have three tattoos. the first is on my back: a phoenix. the second on my stomach: a lotus. the third on my right arm: a muted posthorn. the muted posthorn comes from my favorite novel the crying of lot 49 by thomas pynchon.<br \\/> 20) it took me 34 years to discover that i am a serious work-a-holic. i'm slowly coming to terms with this.\"},\"2264\":{\"secret\":\"i

was in my best interest to get back to the states i said farewell to my friends and acquaintances in northern france. it had been a long 11 months of adventure and due to my procrastination to return i had a mere 3 days until my fixed ticket return flight from amsterdam to san francisco.<br \\/> <br \\/> as usual i had no money. cedric my traveling companion for much of that 11 months was sorry to see me go. he left me playing music on the streets in caen. i made the usual 30 francs and hopped on the train.... without a ticket.<br \\/> <br \\/> the train from caen to paris was a pleasant evening ride. no pesky controller looking for tickets. paris of course was a different story. a few days prior a bomb had gone off in the subway and the station was combing with military police. i chickened out on 3 of the 4 evening bullet trains headed to amsterdam. tickets were being checked prior to boarding which was not the usual drill. i sat around nervously for hours until i had no choice. the last train was boarding.<br \\/> <br \\/> i watched all the normal passengers line up until finally the telecom announced final boarding call. people now in a hurry. the controllers started blowing their whistles. military police dogs and guns walking in their calculated patterns.<br \\/> <br \\/> it was my chance. i ran towards the train the engines were starting up. i was waving towards my imaginary parents when i was stopped and asked for my ticket. \\\"ticket?\\\" i said surprised. \\\"oh right shit! it's somewhere in my bag.\\\" i began to look through my backpack. \\\"just get on!\\\" he said obviously annoyed \\\"we'll check it inside the train is leaving\\\".<br \\/> <br \\/> inside i was overwhelmed with relief. i kept going until i felt i was about in the center of the train. by the time i found a cabin the train had been on the move for a good 10 minutes. i choose to sit next to a disheveled looking moroccan for strategic reasons knowing that the prejudice of the french would take attention away from me. it's hard to actually evade the controllers on the bullet trains since there are few stops where you can get on and off. this evening was a simple matter of getting as far north as possible.<br \\/> <br \\/> i took a nap.<br \\/> <br \\/> i was woken up to the sight and sound of 2 meaty looking controllers making fun of the moroccan guys passport (i have to admit it was in bad shape). my french isn't very good but i believe they where debating whether or not it was counterfeit. they finally decided it was valid and turned to me. \\\"ticket and passport\\\". i handed over my passport and told them that i was late to the station and that my family was on somewhere with my ticket. they were clearly not amused and talked to themselves. the bigger of the two leaned towards me while the other one was writing down my passport information. \\\"he showed me the price of the ticket on his calculator. \\\"i suspect your family also has your money?\\\". they radioed in. \\\"there are no others corbin's on the train come with us.\\\"<br \\/> <br \\/> the conversation to the operating switch was in a phrase: matter of fact. the whistle began to blow. an announcement went over the speakers. the train would be making an unscheduled stop. the screeching of the wheels began. it took about 10 minutes for the train to finally come to a halt. by that time i had been escorted to an exit point a firm grip on my arm the entire time.<br \\/> <br \\/> the doors slid open and i was literally pushed out.<br \\/> <br \\/> outside there was a beautiful midnight sky. in fact i had made it about 2 hours north of paris and looking around quickly got the impression that this was a quaint french ville in the middle of nowhere. the controllers were laughing and yelling obscenities that made no sense. the train began to start. it's wheels straining under the gigantic weight to build up to it's bullet speeds.<br \\/> <br \\/> i watched the momentum and noticed an interesting detail.<br \\/> <br \\/> it wasn't just the door that i was thrown out of that had opened. all the doors had opened. i watched them pass me by. one by one each moving slightly faster and i felt hypnotized in a way that only happens when you have made up your mind to do something crazy. with a brave (and admittedly clumsy) leap.<br \\/> <br \\/> i was back in the train.<br \\/> <br \\/> it was dark and i soon realized that i was in first class. everyone had their own cabins and i began making my way towards the back of the train hoping to find

day. its very existence at this point sort of baffles me because a) i thought i had very pointedly destroyed all of these documents of my youth b) my pop has moved so many times since then and so even though he has probably handled it a dozen times he has never mentioned seeing it. just weird. he didn't mention its inclusion in the little package he sent either. in reading it i guess i was kind of surprised that i was able to immediately recall most of the kids who had written in it. there were all kinds of silly traditions as to what you were supposed to write like this little couplet by samuel grimsby a quiet dark-haired athletic boy who i remember was actually pretty nice to me: when you get married and live in a shack give me a picture of each little brat. thank you samuel. good lordy i just have to take a minute to say that i am writing this on my homeboy's computer (hi chad if you're actually reading this) and i am listening to the fleet foxes on his itunes their self-titled album and they are ripping my heart out! anyway there was even a special way you had to fold each page and most important of all was who you got to sign the sixteenth page of your book because that's the person you are gonna marry! oh yes for reals! so without being too much of a crybaby about it i will just say that there was no way any girl was going to sign my sixteenth page so-beware!!! patheticness alert!!!! -i actually got this really sweet girlnamed jennie page to sign a page in my little book and then i cut it out and glued it in the place of the sixteenth page certainly not to show anybody at school but mostly so i could show my dad and tell him i had a girlfriend because i knew he would really like thinking that.\"},\"3467\":{\"secret\":\"i have a freckle

though about 80% of the population have herpes somewhere on their person (genital or oral) and many of them ether don't know or don't tell because they are afraid to be rejected or don't care. with

on a road trip in tibet. our first stop was ganden monastery a place on top of a very big hill. there were a whole bunch of statues lots of yak butter candles and i had a mala blessed for my friend. after the tour i asked my guide if i could go up behind the monastery and look out onto the valley below. \\\"sure!\\\" he said. i scrambled up the rocky slope and cast my gaze across the himalayas. there was a tibetan family picnicking on the other side of the mountain. the mother was peeing right there in the open probably because she had too much coffee that morning.<br \\/> <br \\/> after a few minutes of that splendid vista i decided to not keep the driver waiting. i felt my way back down the hill but couldn't quite find the same path. all of a sudden a dog came out of nowhere and started barking at me!<br \\/> <br \\/> (now the thing you need to know is that all monasteries in tibet have packs of semi-feral dogs half-guarding the place. i'm not sure exactly if they're pets or attack dogs or what but they belong to the monks and are probably somehow blessed.)<br \\/> <br \\/> anyways this dog is barking at me. and he is <strong>pissed<\\/strong>. this little buddy is not going to let me anywhere near the monastery let alone back to my jeep on the other side of the buildings. at first he wasn't quite sure what to do but he started sizing me up. circling. creeping closer. getting louder. figuring out if i might be a good substitute for dinner. then... my cell phone rang.<br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"hello tim! this is your tour guide tili!\\\" (tili was born in india. he has a very strong accent.)<br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"yes tili what's up?\\\"<br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"i am down in the barking log!\\\" (he is attempting to pronounce parking lot. roll with it.)<br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"that's excellent tili i'll be down there in a few minutes.\\\"<br \\/> <br \\/> (the dog is getting closer.)<br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"no no no! i said i am down in the parking lod. you will come meet us yes?\\\"<br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"yes tili i'll be down there in a bit.\\\"<br \\/> <br \\/> (the dog is sweeping closer and closer. his angry bristles just brushed my pants leg.)<br \\/> <br \\/>

point i realize that tili can probably see me trying to dodge this attack animal on the mountain top. being a wise soul i ask the local for directions.)<br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"tili what do i do about the dog?\\\"<br \\/> <br \\/> <strong>\\\"hit it in the head with a rock!\\\"<\\/strong><br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"ok!\\\"<br \\/> <br \\/> i hang up pick up the biggest rock near my feet look into the

wanted to help and because i wanted to make some money to buy some toy or another. so my father folded an apron over in half tying it around me just under my armpits (as otherwise it would have dragged on the ground) and handed me a washcloth telling me to bus tables by following the waitresses and doing or getting whatever they needed to get the tables ready. one day a family sits down for

leg back for stretches while you're hot and sweaty. sounds like a bad porno already.<br \\/> <br \\/> 7. writers\\/bloggers<br \\/> your whole relationship can be an ongoing interview and every

strippers<br \\/> just because t-pain fell in love with his local pole dancer and made a song about it doesn't mean you have to. dating either a male or female stripper means breaking through and

he didn't call me when he came to rockridge which nearly cost him his almost-hero status.<br \\/> <br \\/> 15 - i spent most of the time i lived in rossendale lancashire wishing that food came in little pills rather than shapeless colourless blobs. since leaving rossendale i've grown to love food and have become a half decent cook. and of course the irony of all this is that i can't take pills.<br \\/> <br \\/> 16 - i regard most drugs as just excuses for not dealing with one's life. of course this does not include anything i personally like such as alcohol in most forms and occasional dabbling in marijuana.<br \\/> <br \\/> 17 - i had classical flute training from when i was 10 or so till - beh i don't remember - 14 maybe. i could play reasonably well and was a member of various school bands and such. my lessons all ended one day when the teacher made a mistake by thinking that we had stopped going when in fact we were just on holiday and booked someone else in our slot. my mother threw a tantrum and that was that.<br \\/> <br \\/> 18 - before i knew better i was largely conservative. i thought that people could make their lives whatever they wanted them to be regardless of their background. now i believe that our society's most important function is to ensure that our children get the education they deserve. blaming kids for being born into poor families is simply selling our world's future to useless rich people for a few lousy bucks.<br \\/> <br \\/> 19 - imho religion and intelligence are mutually exclusive.<br \\/> <br \\/> 20 - i've never really had \\\"normal\\\" jobs as people might describe them. i've never worked as a waiter or in any retail capacity. the closest job i had to anything like that was working in a print finishing company handling machines which made books and magazines out of printed sheets. i got my first engineering job when i was 20.<br \\/> <br \\/> 21 - during the time i was supposed to be paying attention at school i scribbled instead. i wrote a fantasy novel when i was 15 and countless short stories etc. i even wrote crappy uninformed porn which my mother found while clearing out my room. i couldn't stop myself writing.<br \\/> <br \\/> 22 - i joined the lovemakers in 2002 signed a major label deal in 2004 and quit in 2006.<br \\/> <br \\/> 23 - i did aids\\/lifecycle 7 and i'm signing up for next year. people ask me why we do such a crazy thing and offer various \\\"is it this?\\\" answers. i usually answer \\\"all of the above\\\" but the main reasons are (1) there is hiv in the family and (2) it's such a ridiculous thing to do that it has to be done.<br \\/> <br \\/> 24 - i'm not really a proctor. i'm more of a smithies.<br \\/> <br \\/> 25 - i think anything is worth doing if it's funny<br \\/> <br \\/> 26 - i think life's funnier if you're crap<br \\/> <br \\/> 27 - i spent my 18th birthday at a mediaeval castle in cheshire\"},\"11980\":{\"secret\":\"i use the word

\\/> in the past but i inevitably find myself wandering its many<br \\/> disappointing corridors of broken hearts and forlorn glances if<br \\/> only to deepen the wounds upon my heart from when i last came to<br \\/> the okcupid.<br \\/> <br \\/> 'tis a tragic story if you wish to humor this lady's tale.<br \\/> <br \\/> it began in the summer of 1894 where edward norton still ruled san<br \\/> francisco and tea time was not disrespected as it is today. in<br \\/> fact twas the best year for tea times before sir rutherman iii<br \\/> took that nasty fall involving the tribals and the oriental ghost<br \\/> upon the bungalow in paris in the february of '95 and sir gahveryly<br \\/> took over and popularized all those ghastly reforms. but i digress.<br \\/> i was dallying the pages of the okcupid admiring the sights (as<br \\/> much as a fine lady can admire the mish mash of cads hooligans<br \\/> and boorish louts) when a gentleman called upon my doorstep<br \\/> leaving a telegram of awkward proposals and a date upon a zeppelin.<br \\/> although awkward and fumbling i was none too offended by his<br \\/> demeanor nor did he completely lack of charm so we arranged to<br \\/> meet by zeppelin on the saturday of the week.<br \\/> <br \\/> we met upon the zeppelin admired the peaks and valleys of san<br \\/> francisco drank tea and discussed the current policies put forth<br \\/> by edward norton recently concerning kittens and galvanic<br \\/> equipment. things were rather tepid for the most part my gentleman<br \\/> companion some paul v brown or somesuch until a vicious sky<br \\/> pirate came upon us! using his air dirigible his motley crew<br \\/> raided our luxury craft and went about looting and stealing all<br \\/> they could get their grubby hands on.<br \\/> <br \\/> oh! but the captain! that captain of the ship! how dashing he was!<br \\/> unlike the filthy curs going every which way laying their grubby<br \\/> hands on any treasure he stood above them like some beautiful<br \\/> marble david as if the world were some mighty goliath he just<br \\/> slain. whether it be confidence or arrogance smitten across his<br \\/> face i knew that his soul was forever smitten upon my heart. some<br \\/> such reason could be why my mouth spoke these words before i could<br \\/> even stop myself:<br \\/> <br \\/> \\\"oh pirate! you can plunder the gold steal the treasures ransack<br \\/> the reserves! but i will not be satisfied unless you whisk me away<br \\/> upon your mighty vessel!\\\"<br \\/> <br \\/> i instantly covered my mouth and moved back to hide. but 'twas too<br \\/> late; his gaze met mine and he slowly walked with swagger and<br \\/> glamour towards me. i could do nothing i was paralyzed my heart<br \\/> was pounding out of passion or fear i knew not but my gentleman was<br \\/> absolutely terrified. \\\"back scoundrel!\\\" he shouted as he drew his<br \\/> rapier but the pirate king merely slapped it aside with nary a<br \\/> thought then lay a good left hook across his face. while impressed<br \\/> by my friend's momentary courage i swooned at the pirate;s<br \\/> virility. soon i was in his arms and whisked back upon his<br \\/> airship.<br \\/> <br \\/> i joined the pirate king on his many voyages across the sky for<br \\/> several months as a impassioned companion and partner in crime. we<br \\/> raided we loved we sang and drank and ate and he made sure not<br \\/> another pirate layed even a finger upon me. while surrounded by<br \\/> dogs he was more of a gentleman than any mainland ponce. something<br \\/> though always pried in the back of my mind a worm of doubt that<br \\/> wriggled through the apple of my paradise. for you see at least<br \\/> once a day my pirate king would disappear for perhaps an hour or<br \\/> two on end every day unable to be found anywhere i could get to<br \\/> upon the ship.<br \\/> <br \\/> one day when we were to have tea upon the poop deck of the ship<br \\/> he was absent. i inquired around the ship for his presence but none<br \\/> knew where he was. so i pilfered the desk at our quarters (being<br \\/> now a pirate queen i have learned a little of loose moralities)<br \\/> and found upon a hidden drawer a key to the hold that i've never<br \\/> seen before. there was one chamber in the hold that was perpetually<br \\/> locked; while perplexing i knew not to push my curiosities too far.<br \\/> but however on this day my instincts told me that i must discover<br \\/> what was behind that door. so down i went putting key to lock and<br \\/> discovering what lay behind the forbidden door...<br \\/> <br \\/> oh the shock! the horror! there was paul v green or somesuch there<br \\/> clad in the most revealing and unusual of black leather garment<br \\/> and my dear pirate king bent over like some serf licking his boots!<br \\/> i almost didn't recognize my dear as he had on some horrendous<br \\/> leather mask but i could tell from the depths of the eyes behind it<br \\/> that it was indeed my love my companion scoundrel ruler. for i was<br \\/> not the only one stolen from the zeppelin on that fateful day but<br \\/> so was my gentleman caller! and there he was partaking in some<br \\/> horrid ritual of servitude and utter debauchery! i left tears<br \\/> streaming down my eyes and a virulent mixture of rage and bitter<br \\/> betrayal brewing a toxic concoction upon my soul.<br \\/> <br \\/> i stole a life ship and as much loot as i could sneak off that<br \\/> night. i made a new name and a new life. i returned to the annals<br \\/> of the okcupid. but lo and behold on my return to society i<br \\/> discovered the profile of the very same pirate king upon my<br \\/> okcupid who in fact showed up as a \\\"similar user\\\" to the paul<br \\/> whatshisname! similar except he was marked as \\\"more kinky\\\" and<br \\/> marked as \\\"bi\\\" and \\\"available\\\"! oh the shame i felt! to be turned<br \\/> aside in favor of a kink-gaylord-fancy-nancy! my heart has been<br \\/> irreparable to this day which is why i have cast off from the<br \\/> harbor of okcupid to set sail and swear off the lands

admit:<br \\/> <br \\/> 1. i've hung out on separate occasions with two different members of the village people. several years ago i had the pleasure of spending the afternoon with filipe rose (the indian) during san francisco's pride celebration. years later after attending a 'very merry disco christmas' at the castro theater i got the opportunity to hang out with randy jones (the cowboy) who was both incredibly sweet and very personable. to this day \\\"can't stop the music\\\" remains one of my favorite movies of all time. i feel fortunate i was able to see the original village people perform in concert in vancouver many moons ago.<br \\/> <br \\/> 2. i played baby garfield in an elementary school musical production. i even had a solo singing part! i don't remember much about the experience except i rather over-acted through the whole thing. it would be the end of my acting career.<br \\/> <br \\/> 3. i love horror movies! i can watch the most gory stomach-turning films without having nightmares and yet i have arachnophobia. if you want to see me lose it watch arachnophobia with me one night and watch me freak out. i can't stand spiders.<br \\/> <br \\/> 4. i am a total kid at heart. i can spend hours in novelty gift and toy stores. i still love to go to amusement parks and ride roller coasters.<br \\/> <br \\/> 5. i dream of one day owning a modern home like something out of the pages of dwell. the design within reach catalog is my idea of porn.<br \\/> <br \\/> 6. when i was a child my brother and sisters told me i was adopted and made me cry.<br \\/> <br \\/> 7. my feelings are hurt easily.<br \\/> <br \\/> 8. i am addicted to reality tv. i can't get enough of it. i love it all--project runway real housewives america's next top model top chef american idol celebrity apprentice wife swap survivor--you name it. if it's reality tv chances are i've got a season pass on my tivo.<br \\/> <br \\/> 9. i love the 80s!--the music the movies the fashion. i still love watching reruns of degrassi junior high and get excited watching a good john hughes film. sixteen candles the breakfast club and pretty in pink are my coming-of-age movies. i'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to see some of my favorite artists in concert over the past few years: human league duran duran abc howard jones dead or alive berlin pet shop boys erasure.<br \\/> <br \\/> 10. i used to go out dancing in the most embarrassing outfits when i was younger. the pice de rsistance was going out clubbing in a jockstrap with a pair of bare-assed chaps in the middle of a snowstorm. to this day i wonder what on earth i was thinking.<br \\/> <br \\/> 11. i don't want to grow up.<br \\/> <br \\/> 12. i still get excited when i find out bananarama are releasing a new single.<br \\/> <br \\/> 13. my mother once made me order her the flowbee an electric powered vacuum attachment made for cutting hair. to my horror i actually ordered it but fortunately it never arrived.<br \\/> <br \\/> 14. i was upset when wham split up.<br \\/> <br \\/> 15. when i was 19 i drank an entire bottle of red wine before a night out dancing. before i could make it to the club i proceeded to throw up in my best friend's car. i am thankful she forgave me. and to my brother who had to clean up the mess. those white denim jeans would never be the same.<br \\/> <br \\/> 16. i still enjoy watching cartoons. i believe that sid &amp; marty krofft and pee wee herman are underrated geniuses.<br \\/> <br \\/> 17. i get lost easily. it's painfully

me.<br \\/> <br \\/> 19. i have a brother a year older than myself who many people mistake for my twin. we look alike sound alike and act alike. we are so similar but completely different.<br \\/> <br \\/> 20. i once went to a triple feature of rollerboogie xanadu and skatetown usa. it was one of the best nights of my life.<br \\/> <br \\/> 21. i do not cook. everything i eat is either frozen
