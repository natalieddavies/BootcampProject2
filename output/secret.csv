hmm so you want to know my little secret ey? well i believe that especially in relationships the problem is often too _little_ openness so i am more into telling as much as possible as accurately as possible and sooner rather than later. there are really only 2 reasons i keep secrets:<br /> <br /> 1. because they involve other people. unless i know they are ok with it i try not to bandy about things that they would rather keep private.<br /> <br /> 2. because i want to keep it for later. for example i am not going to tell you what is in your present until you've opened it.<br /> <br /> as for all the weird and wonderful things i haven't told you yet...if you are interested send me a message and start discovering! :-d,likes cats

i suffer from a debilitating disorder that forces me to disclose my thoughts and feelings even when i should keep them to myself. some find this refreshing others think it's rude. i wear my heart on my sleeve so you never need to guess what i am thinking. i am direct and assertive and prefer people who are the same (at least with me). i can't imagine anything 'more' private that a stranger would want to know but go ahead and ask - odds are i'll answer.,likes both

"embrace-<br /> <br /> one day quietly with no warning she said ""will you hold me?""<br /> and so he did of course. his arms around her in an embrace that fitted his body to hers. kissing her hair eyelids tip of nose. asking ""did something go wrong? did you have a scare?""<br /> she seems not to have heard her arms around him tight tight.<br /> feeling against her cheek the comforting scratchiness of the wool sweater she'd knitted him years ago. when they were newly lovers.<br /> minutes passed. how very odd. he felt her trembling -- a deep subterranean shuttering. he asked<br /> ""you didn't have an accident with your car did you?"" and<br /> ""did someone threaten you?"" and ""what is it?""<br /> still she made no reply. gripping him close.<br /> so he was having difficulty breathing. so his heartbeat quickened as if in the presence of danger.<br /> he said ""darling please i love you - what is it?""<br /> he tried gently to push her away from him just a bit so that he could see her face. for suddenly it seemed to him he could not recall her face.<br /> but she was holding him tight tight.<br /> saying almost inaudibly so that he felt rather than heard her words ""just hold me.""<br /> ""yes but -- what is it?""<br /> how many minutes of this embrace could he endure? five? ten? sixty? one thousand? he said bravely ""yes. i'm here.""<br /> outside an unexpected rain pelted against the windows -- or was that sunshine? that sudden glare?<br /> <br /> joyce carol oates<br /> from where is here",likes both

"i cry during really sad movies. in a movie theater i will make believe i am scratching my face only to do a discreet wipe. i would advise you to wear a raincoat during old yeller. sad but true. btw what's with the name old yeller? are we to assume the aging dog was hoarse a majority of the time? or is it that home schooling is not all it's cracked up to be? also- if the dog was yelling enough to justify his name can we be sure it was rabies and not some rat poison from an annoyed neighbor? after all who wouldn't be a little cranky after eating rat poison? i don't think an autopsy is out of the question at this point however i will be really disappointed if turns out that daniel boone poisoned the dog. certainly anyone who chooses to wear part of an animal carcass on his head has to be a little suspect. i wonder what his slippers were made out of? hollowed out pit bull heads? king of the wild frontier? lord of the flies if you ask me. this chap warrants a closer look. yes and one more thing about daniel boone in the 50's he inspired boys to complement their fashion with raccoon tails. okay fine but at one end of the tail there used to be a raccoon what happened to it? at the very least the guy was kind of hard on mammals.<br /> <br /> just to let you know that i am also reasonably macho (the good kind of course...) i once got in the ring with a middleweight that tko'd roberto duran. unfortunately it turns out there's a pretty big difference between amateur and professional boxing i didn't cry afterwards but i probably should have. oddly enough that moment thrust me into two boxing magazines and hustler. with my photo. i always wondered if someone from high school wondered what happened to me picked up a hustler and thought ""oh there he is bloody and in hustler...""<br /> <br /> there should be a ""most likely to end up in hustler bleeding"" category for the yearbook. or most likely to digress. or most likely to be maimed by a 50% enemy and stranger who i feel might be overstepping her sensible anger blueprint. 50% enemy lady: if you are reading this i meant that in the nicest possible way and also i live in wyoming. north wyoming.<br /> <br /> on the myers briggs i am a ""testgiver: contact authorities as soon as possible"" whatever that means.",likes cats

it seems like a lot of gay guys are really into knitting. i don't know why. but of all the hobbies out there that one is disproportionately popular. so much that it's a part of the subculture in many people's minds. in fact we're apparently all expected to walk around in our homespun articles of clothing regardless of context - it's completely impractical and useless to wear those mittens inside where it's warm but you have them anyway just to show off! a bit of fine needlework is all it takes to become instantly attractive and out of my league and a lack thereof is an immediate disqualifier. and knitting is such a huge part of some guys' lives that they refuse to date anyone who doesn't share the pastime. even the less prolific knitters still expect to see me in a basic shawl or scarf. alas i have several hobbies and that's just not one of them; it doesn't bother me if that's how you get your jollies but i get a little bit annoyed if you ascribe that much importance to it and if it's an instant dealbreaker for you then as far as i'm concerned you've saved me the trouble.<br /> <br /> replace knitting with the cult of gym and this is how i feel.,other

"here is one story..<br /> <br /> having finally decided that it was in my best interest to get back to the states i said farewell to my friends and acquaintances in northern france. it had been a long 11 months of adventure and due to my procrastination to return i had a mere 3 days until my fixed ticket return flight from amsterdam to san francisco.<br /> <br /> as usual i had no money. cedric my traveling companion for much of that 11 months was sorry to see me go. he left me playing music on the streets in caen. i made the usual 30 francs and hopped on the train.... without a ticket.<br /> <br /> the train from caen to paris was a pleasant evening ride. no pesky controller looking for tickets. paris of course was a different story. a few days prior a bomb had gone off in the subway and the station was combing with military police. i chickened out on 3 of the 4 evening bullet trains headed to amsterdam. tickets were being checked prior to boarding which was not the usual drill. i sat around nervously for hours until i had no choice. the last train was boarding.<br /> <br /> i watched all the normal passengers line up until finally the telecom announced final boarding call. people now in a hurry. the controllers started blowing their whistles. military police dogs and guns walking in their calculated patterns.<br /> <br /> it was my chance. i ran towards the train the engines were starting up. i was waving towards my imaginary parents when i was stopped and asked for my ticket. ""ticket?"" i said surprised. ""oh right shit! it's somewhere in my bag."" i began to look through my backpack. ""just get on!"" he said obviously annoyed ""we'll check it inside the train is leaving"".<br /> <br /> inside i was overwhelmed with relief. i kept going until i felt i was about in the center of the train. by the time i found a cabin the train had been on the move for a good 10 minutes. i choose to sit next to a disheveled looking moroccan for strategic reasons knowing that the prejudice of the french would take attention away from me. it's hard to actually evade the controllers on the bullet trains since there are few stops where you can get on and off. this evening was a simple matter of getting as far north as possible.<br /> <br /> i took a nap.<br /> <br /> i was woken up to the sight and sound of 2 meaty looking controllers making fun of the moroccan guys passport (i have to admit it was in bad shape). my french isn't very good but i believe they where debating whether or not it was counterfeit. they finally decided it was valid and turned to me. ""ticket and passport"". i handed over my passport and told them that i was late to the station and that my family was on somewhere with my ticket. they were clearly not amused and talked to themselves. the bigger of the two leaned towards me while the other one was writing down my passport information. ""he showed me the price of the ticket on his calculator. ""i suspect your family also has your money?"". they radioed in. ""there are no others corbin's on the train come with us.""<br /> <br /> the conversation to the operating switch was in a phrase: matter of fact. the whistle began to blow. an announcement went over the speakers. the train would be making an unscheduled stop. the screeching of the wheels began. it took about 10 minutes for the train to finally come to a halt. by that time i had been escorted to an exit point a firm grip on my arm the entire time.<br /> <br /> the doors slid open and i was literally pushed out.<br /> <br /> outside there was a beautiful midnight sky. in fact i had made it about 2 hours north of paris and looking around quickly got the impression that this was a quaint french ville in the middle of nowhere. the controllers were laughing and yelling obscenities that made no sense. the train began to start. it's wheels straining under the gigantic weight to build up to it's bullet speeds.<br /> <br /> i watched the momentum and noticed an interesting detail.<br /> <br /> it wasn't just the door that i was thrown out of that had opened. all the doors had opened. i watched them pass me by. one by one each moving slightly faster and i felt hypnotized in a way that only happens when you have made up your mind to do something crazy. with a brave (and admittedly clumsy) leap.<br /> <br /> i was back in the train.<br /> <br /> it was dark and i soon realized that i was in first class. everyone had their own cabins and i began making my way towards the back of the train hoping to find a place where i could blend in. i finally made it as far as i could go. the door to second class was locked....",likes both

i am pretty much an open book and rather shameless but i'll just illustrate how desperately lonely i was as a child with this because who wants anybody to know how lonely they've been? anyway<br /> i recently got a fedex package from my pop and along with some random comic books of mine he'd found was an object i instantly recognized-the autograph book all fifth grade students of the elementary school i'd attended in new jersey were given on graduation day. its very existence at this point sort of baffles me because a) i thought i had very pointedly destroyed all of these documents of my youth b) my pop has moved so many times since then and so even though he has probably handled it a dozen times he has never mentioned seeing it. just weird. he didn't mention its inclusion in the little package he sent either. in reading it i guess i was kind of surprised that i was able to immediately recall most of the kids who had written in it. there were all kinds of silly traditions as to what you were supposed to write like this little couplet by samuel grimsby a quiet dark-haired athletic boy who i remember was actually pretty nice to me: when you get married and live in a shack give me a picture of each little brat. thank you samuel. good lordy i just have to take a minute to say that i am writing this on my homeboy's computer (hi chad if you're actually reading this) and i am listening to the fleet foxes on his itunes their self-titled album and they are ripping my heart out! anyway there was even a special way you had to fold each page and most important of all was who you got to sign the sixteenth page of your book because that's the person you are gonna marry! oh yes for reals! so without being too much of a crybaby about it i will just say that there was no way any girl was going to sign my sixteenth page so-beware!!! patheticness alert!!!! -i actually got this really sweet girlnamed jennie page to sign a page in my little book and then i cut it out and glued it in the place of the sixteenth page certainly not to show anybody at school but mostly so i could show my dad and tell him i had a girlfriend because i knew he would really like thinking that.,likes both

this is a burning man story - my last year was my seventh burn and i went out to the basura sagrada on the night of the burn with a friend. i had had a really hard year - working through a divorce an old burner lover died of an overdose laid off from my job a close artistic partner had died randomly out of the blue... and here i was at the temple reflecting on all that.<br /> i had done a tarot reading for myself recently which is generally pretty accurate and the general reading was that i was going to manage and balance things very well. except up there on the temple i didn't feel like it all. i didn't feel strong and adaptable. i felt alone and broken down. not sure about my future. just too much random shit happening throughout my life. so many dead friends too young no security love just not working out. not like i wanted to throw a pity party for myself it was just all coming to head right there. and so i'm sitting on the upper level of the temple in ridiculously high winds and the whole structure is shaking and the pieces of junk that the construction team has nailed to the frame are all rattling and waving and suddenly it hits me.<br /> i'm as strong as the temple. you can take pieces of junk things that other people have thrown away and discarded and turn them into something beautiful. the wind can blow as hard as it likes but the structure isn't coming down. one because it's built right but also because there are 50 thousand people out here right now who have put their belief their spirit right into this thing. yes it's formed from all these broken things but ultimately it's the strongest platform on the playa. and i'm just as broken flawed and as strong as the temple.<br /> <br /> and the wind stops.,likes both

"one of my earliest memories - certainly the earliest that i can easily recall - is of being nearly 4 years old at the first house i lived in on park street in new iberia. i was sitting at the kitchen table to a dinner of grits and eggs. i know that grits and eggs is typically considered breakfast food but i grew up in a household where breakfast wasn't just the most important meal of the day; it was my favorite. so i ate it at every meal.<br /> <br /> i was pushing 4 and yearning for independence so i wanted to eat all by myself and with a fork. my dad was fine with that but he had to stand over me while i ate - just to make sure that i didn't puncture my tonsils with the newly-weaponized eating utensil.<br /> <br /> this happened around 1983 back when parents weren't so cautious about exposing their kids to second-hand smoke. my parents happened to be smokers and my dad stood over me while i ate my... brinner(?) with a cigarette dangling from his lips. then the unthinkable happened. a long chunk of cigarette ash fell from his cigarette and right into the center of my plate. as a child i took food very seriously. when pleased with a meal i was known to hum and wiggle my toes. when displeased i would do precisely what i did when my dad's disgusting cigarette ashes plopped into my meal: i wailed like a baby.<br /> <br /> my dad didn't know what to do. three kids 3.5 years of fatherhood and never had he unintentionally inspired that much unhappiness. not knowing what else to do and seeking to immediately alleviate the situation he grabbed a fork spooned up the heap of grits with the offending ashes and ate it.

"""out beyond ideas of right-doing and wrong-doing there is a field. i'll meet you there.""<br /> <br /> this beautiful rumi quote sums up my approach to relationship pretty well.<br /> <br /> i believe if two people are able to communicate deeply from a place of non-judgment and non-blame they can almost always find empathy for each other. even if they disagree it's possible in my experience to come to a deep understanding of each other that builds respect and connection over time.<br /> <br /> my early relationships including my long-ago marriage were in what i consider a conventional relationship model -- we enjoyed the good and didn't effectively deal with the problems irritants and judgments that inevitably cropped up. as long as the good exceeded the bad we were okay. but by leaving the weeds untended they eventually overtook the garden.<br /> <br /> most relationships seem to work like this with or without the divorce... which is why i'd rather be single than in most relationships i've seen....<br /> <br /> i need a partner who is committed to actively nurturing the relationship. communicating about issues is not the dominant part of the relationship -- what would be the point? -- but tending the garden is a priority for me.<br /> <br /> to create an emotionally transparent relationship a compatible fellow would need to know his own emotional landscape and be committed to compassionately and non-judgmentally working through the baggage -- his hers and ours.<br /> <br /> if you believe you have no need to explore your psyche no desire to do relationship processing and/or no experience doing either of the above we are most likely incompatible.<br /> <br /> but i do wish you the best! godspeed in finding your dream girl.",likes both

i'm the kind of person that if asked would probably tell you anything you wanted to know about my life so here is private for you.<br /> <br /> i have genital herpes(hsv1). woah boyo is it a stigma! it has presented me with a quit a lot of rejection and that has been pretty annoying and frustrating... although it has also been a good lesson in letting go of control. hsv1 is not very hard to protect against but because people are not educated about it they are sometimes afraid and so people with herpes are often ruled out as sexual partners. truth is though about 80% of the population have herpes somewhere on their person (genital or oral) and many of them ether don't know or don't tell because they are afraid to be rejected or don't care. with that percentage you may have been with somebody that has herpes and not had the chance to say no. so if you meet somebody like me who is honest and upfront about it and you are interested in them  don't cross them off your to do list right away.<br /> <br /> fyi i got genital herpes from receiving oral sex so watch out for cold sores. and as you can tell i'm happy to educate people about herpes because it can be a bummer but it is not the end of the world. plus the more you know the less likely you are to contract herpes in the first place.,likes both

i am all for getting rid of the stigma associated with receiving therapy. i think the world would be such a better place if everyone could have a therapist. i currently receive a particular type of psychotherapy that uses imagery to manage and interpret larger psychological phenomena.

"have you ever noticed how ""private"" is relative? some people will tell you the number of people they've slept with but balk at the number on their paychecks. others feel exactly the opposite. that said in the interest of fulfilling the purpose of this poorly-worded question story time:<br /> <br /> once i kissed someone whose name i don't remember just because he asked me nicely. i hadn't told him my correct name and i ended up checking the oil in my pickup myself (which was what i told him he had to do for the kiss) but i kissed him anyway. i still remember the cool softness of his lips and the lingering sweet-spicy taste of his clove cigarette. he tried to talk me out of reapplying my lipstick quite so soon but when i did it anyway he held his peace.<br /> <br /> i like that in a person. i generally respond well to people who are willing to ask for what they want plainly but with no expectations and then accept when i give all i'm willing to up front and draw the line. push and push back is good and persistence is a virtue but there is a definite limit to that when boundaries have been clearly defined.<br /> <br /> and...<br /> there is a candle in my window for someone i've never met but the person who can answer it is a very rare sort and may not even exist. i'm comfortable with this. someday it would be nice to find a real partner one who understands me and unconsciously speaks the same language of love who loves the way sharing enriches the lives of all involved but will give me priority whom i can engage with in the dance of love and life who will support and uplift and work with me as much as i do for them with as little complaint. someone who understands the need to love deeply and hold each other lightly.<br /> only once has anyone ever loved me enough to give me up and help me go my way and to get me to commit to a partnership i'd need another love that strong. i'm not sure i believe i'm blessed enough to experience such a precious and rare thing more than once in one lifetime.",likes dogs

when i was 12 my brother (who was 8) and i got locked out on the deck while my parents were away a good 15 feet from the ground below. so we devised a plan where he would grab a hold of the clothesline that ran from the deck to a tree about 50 feet away. once he'd grabbed on the plan required that i wheel him to the center of the line (the line was on a pulley) so that he could gently hop on to the ground (the line dipped in the middle.)<br /> <br /> i grabbed onto our side of the line and he stepped off the deck. and fell straight to the ground. the pulley on the other end had come out of the tree it'd been anchored to and my stubby 12 year old fingers hadn't been able to hold onto our end either.<br /> <br /> luckily he was fine. and we were able to get inside after all. i've tried to a be a better brother since.,likes both

"once many years ago i was on a road trip in tibet. our first stop was ganden monastery a place on top of a very big hill. there were a whole bunch of statues lots of yak butter candles and i had a mala blessed for my friend. after the tour i asked my guide if i could go up behind the monastery and look out onto the valley below. ""sure!"" he said. i scrambled up the rocky slope and cast my gaze across the himalayas. there was a tibetan family picnicking on the other side of the mountain. the mother was peeing right there in the open probably because she had too much coffee that morning.<br /> <br /> after a few minutes of that splendid vista i decided to not keep the driver waiting. i felt my way back down the hill but couldn't quite find the same path. all of a sudden a dog came out of nowhere and started barking at me!<br /> <br /> (now the thing you need to know is that all monasteries in tibet have packs of semi-feral dogs half-guarding the place. i'm not sure exactly if they're pets or attack dogs or what but they belong to the monks and are probably somehow blessed.)<br /> <br /> anyways this dog is barking at me. and he is <strong>pissed</strong>. this little buddy is not going to let me anywhere near the monastery let alone back to my jeep on the other side of the buildings. at first he wasn't quite sure what to do but he started sizing me up. circling. creeping closer. getting louder. figuring out if i might be a good substitute for dinner. then... my cell phone rang.<br /> <br /> ""hello tim! this is your tour guide tili!"" (tili was born in india. he has a very strong accent.)<br /> <br /> ""yes tili what's up?""<br /> <br /> ""i am down in the barking log!"" (he is attempting to pronounce parking lot. roll with it.)<br /> <br /> ""that's excellent tili i'll be down there in a few minutes.""<br /> <br /> (the dog is getting closer.)<br /> <br /> ""no no no! i said i am down in the parking lod. you will come meet us yes?""<br /> <br /> ""yes tili i'll be down there in a bit.""<br /> <br /> (the dog is sweeping closer and closer. his angry bristles just brushed my pants leg.)<br /> <br /> ""ok ok. can you find your way back?""<br /> <br /> ""sure it won't be that hard.""<br /> <br /> ""ok i will hang up now. do you need anything else?""<br /> <br /> (at this point i realize that tili can probably see me trying to dodge this attack animal on the mountain top. being a wise soul i ask the local for directions.)<br /> <br /> ""tili what do i do about the dog?""<br /> <br /> <strong>""hit it in the head with a rock!""</strong><br /> <br /> ""ok!""<br /> <br /> i hang up pick up the biggest rock near my feet look into the dog's eyes and say ""dog i am going to fuck you up.""<br /> <br /> he backed away.",likes both

starting at a young age i mentally assigned gender to inanimate objects symbols and words. for example; the spoon is the woman (mom) the knife is a man (dad) and the fork is somewhat gender neutral (child) though possibly a clear male or female depending on the silverware set. my sister thinks the number 8 is a bald man but she is dead wrong. it is clearly a voluptuous woman. not everything is so blatant but i can usually figure out what i think/feel possible gender might be. that said like most progressive extremely glbtq friendly individuals i believe gender is more of a spectrum kind of thang than a strict set one of two options. however i am firmly on the feminine side of the spectrum.,likes both

im very open i feel that if one is willing to admit and cop to anything in their lives; that if they expose their skeletons that are in their closets first then how will anyone else ever be able to harm them. in exposing your deepest darkest secrets first you keep the power in your hands and take it out of anyone else's.<br /> <br /> sometimes i think that i am too open.<br /> <br /> (12/30/11)i probably wont communicate with anyone unless they visit my profile. (do a bit of looking at pictures but that is it) or unless they contact me first. the visiting of my profile shows me that there is some interest and so i'll probably send a message. but that said that is not true with everyone. sorry ladies but i do have a filter on who i can see and if i don't know that you visited my profile then i don't know to send a message.,likes both

i'm willing to admit that it's hard for me to trust. i've had at least one major instance in which a deep trust was broken and even forgoing that example i've had a hard time really getting comfortable and trusting people with more important things. it's not that i don't trust but it just takes me a while to determine if someone's trustworthy and i've found that many people assume that they have my trust right off the bat. i try to give people more of a chance upon first meeting them but when things start to look serious (either in a friendship or a relationship) trust becomes something that needs to be focused on and it just comes a little more slowly than i wish it did.<br /> <br /> also--a promise means more to me than most people think. it's the ultimate test of trust for me. once you understand me a bit and really get why it's so important if you say that you promise something i will put my entire trust in you following through with your promise. if you break it it breaks my trust and that's not something i take lightly or forgive easily.,likes both

i'm a bit of a pervert. :} &lt;- pervert face<br /> <br /> so... a girl i know has used craigslist casual encounters to hookup with random guys (some probably filled with all sorts of stds) and it got me thinking about the relative response rates for women and men posting in the w4m and m4w sections respectively. i decided to post two fake ads: one posing as a young 19 year old girl looking for casual sex and another posing as a young 23 year old guy looking for casual sex.<br /> <br /> while constructing the ads i made sure to choose pictures (no faces) from the net which were relatively equal in attractiveness. i was careful to write ads which matched up fairly well in terms of what most men would want and most women would want from a casual sex partner although i must admit that i am much better at the former than the latter.<br /> <br /> long story short the w4m ad ended up receiving 150 responses in one night from all sorts of men: some were married; a few were phd students from stanford; many sent the e-mails from facebook linked accounts; and quite a few were markedly more attractive than the girl in the picture that i posted. however the m4w ad received <strong>no</strong> replies save for a few fake responses meant to phish for personal info.<br /> <br /> i guess if you're using the internet to meet strangers for sex it pays to be a girl. i might even go as far as to say if you're using the internet for dating ( la okcupid) it pays to be a girl.,likes both

"i've got two both 100% true stories with no exaggeration:<br /> 1) i learned how to swim in hawaii when i was four years old. my father who owned a restaurant specializing in hawaiian barbecue flew his entire staff out to hawaii for the new year's holiday in order to import some aloha back to the mainland. during the day two big hawaiian ladies would come around with their pick up truck loaded with about twenty kids to take us all to the beach while our parents spent the day shopping or partying or whatever. the first day when we got to the beach these same two big hawaiian ladies would drag us out into the water telling us to hold our breath and close our eyes before dunking us under the water. i got the hang of it pretty quickly and soon after you couldn't keep me out of the water if you wanted to!<br /> <br /> 2) when i was five years old and my father's restaurant was really hitting its stride i asked my father for a job both because i wanted to help and because i wanted to make some money to buy some toy or another. so my father folded an apron over in half tying it around me just under my armpits (as otherwise it would have dragged on the ground) and handed me a washcloth telling me to bus tables by following the waitresses and doing or getting whatever they needed to get the tables ready. one day a family sits down for lunch at a table in ""my area"" and sees me this little five-year-old bussing tables. the father asks me who i am and i cheerfully quip ""i'm patrick! my father owns this place!"" the father grinning replies ""oh really? do you have any recommendations?"" ""sure"" i said without hesitation ""whole suckling pig one hundred thirty-five dollars!""",likes both

"psychologically i'm mostly bulletproof -- you can't offend me though please feel free to try.<br /> <br /> however physically i'm a little *too* sensitive in places...<br /> <br /> someone once asked me for a list of 25 things about myself that not everyone knew. maybe this is an appropriate place to include it... numbered zero to 24 of course.<br /> <br /> 0 - i didn't write this in facebook i wrote it in eudora. thank you and good evening.<br /> <br /> 1 - i was aboard a virgin 747 on climbout from sfo when a bird strike took out one of its engines.<br /> <br /> 2 - if i'd got up at the right time that day i would have been at the wrong place at the wrong time for the manchester ira bomb.<br /> <br /> 3 - i'm partially left handed and partially right handed.<br /> <br /> 4 - i get migraines if my blood sugar gets too low hence i can't fast.<br /> <br /> 5 - i had a benign lump removed from my head when i was about 28.<br /> <br /> 6 - i've never broken a bone or had stitches.<br /> <br /> 7 - i like things which hypnotise me - machines music speed (motion that is not the drug which i haven't tried) presentations (sometimes) going to the optician (weirdly) etc...<br /> <br /> 8 - i generally approach situations with an attitude which approximates to ""what would make the machine work best?"" regardless of what i'm actually dealing with.<br /> <br /> 9 - i don't trust anything unless i know how it works down to the wire.<br /> <br /> 10 - i like things that have purity of vision in their concept - examples would be macintosh rx-7 motm klein belgian beer etc.<br /> <br /> 11 - i was allergic to duck for several years. well i don't know whether it was actually an allergy but it acted like one. i couldn't even smell it without gagging. almost like the allergy i had to vodka for seven years following a particularly protracted experience but different honest.<br /> <br /> 12 - i couldn't belch until i was 33 years old. turns out it's a genetic thing my cousin was similarly affected.<br /> <br /> 13 - i am a stickler for correct spelling and punctuation. america's idiocratic culture is invading the world backed up by the military and that's devolution and degeneration not evolution. we should be celebrating our languages' idiosyncratic features not mangling them. they will never take me alive.<br /> <br /> 14 - i don't have heroes really but the closest i do have is probably michael palin. he's normal and a genius as well. and he didn't call me when he came to rockridge which nearly cost him his almost-hero status.<br /> <br /> 15 - i spent most of the time i lived in rossendale lancashire wishing that food came in little pills rather than shapeless colourless blobs. since leaving rossendale i've grown to love food and have become a half decent cook. and of course the irony of all this is that i can't take pills.<br /> <br /> 16 - i regard most drugs as just excuses for not dealing with one's life. of course this does not include anything i personally like such as alcohol in most forms and occasional dabbling in marijuana.<br /> <br /> 17 - i had classical flute training from when i was 10 or so till - beh i don't remember - 14 maybe. i could play reasonably well and was a member of various school bands and such. my lessons all ended one day when the teacher made a mistake by thinking that we had stopped going when in fact we were just on holiday and booked someone else in our slot. my mother threw a tantrum and that was that.<br /> <br /> 18 - before i knew better i was largely conservative. i thought that people could make their lives whatever they wanted them to be regardless of their background. now i believe that our society's most important function is to ensure that our children get the education they deserve. blaming kids for being born into poor families is simply selling our world's future to useless rich people for a few lousy bucks.<br /> <br /> 19 - imho religion and intelligence are mutually exclusive.<br /> <br /> 20 - i've never really had ""normal"" jobs as people might describe them. i've never worked as a waiter or in any retail capacity. the closest job i had to anything like that was working in a print finishing company handling machines which made books and magazines out of printed sheets. i got my first engineering job when i was 20.<br /> <br /> 21 - during the time i was supposed to be paying attention at school i scribbled instead. i wrote a fantasy novel when i was 15 and countless short stories etc. i even wrote crappy uninformed porn which my mother found while clearing out my room. i couldn't stop myself writing.<br /> <br /> 22 - i joined the lovemakers in 2002 signed a major label deal in 2004 and quit in 2006.<br /> <br /> 23 - i did aids/lifecycle 7 and i'm signing up for next year. people ask me why we do such a crazy thing and offer various ""is it this?"" answers. i usually answer ""all of the above"" but the main reasons are (1) there is hiv in the family and (2) it's such a ridiculous thing to do that it has to be done.<br /> <br /> 24 - i'm not really a proctor. i'm more of a smithies.<br /> <br /> 25 - i think anything is worth doing if it's funny<br /> <br /> 26 - i think life's funnier if you're crap<br /> <br /> 27 - i spent my 18th birthday at a mediaeval castle in cheshire",likes both

sometimes i think that you can pretty much get just about anything you want if you just ask for it. someone is bound to say yes at some point right? so for a while i used to ask people if they would give me a <b>piano</b>. i came close a few times got a few yeses. but they always managed to fall through in the end. so instead i started to ask people to draw me a piano since i figured it might be the closest i'd ever get to actually having one. at this point i've been doing it for a number of years now and have an amazing collection of drawn or painted pianos done on anything from cocktail napkins to big canvases. i even have one painted on a skateboard. and they've come from so many different people from around the world from friends to random strangers at the bar or on a plane. i kinda think these pianos have given me more fulfillment than any real piano in the world could.<br /> <br /> oh. and i still want to be a <b>goonie</b>.,likes dogs

(if that's 'guy speak' for something bad tell me...and i'll move it to the 'bad' column lol)<br /> <br /> now: the good stuff i can't claim:<br /> i have never been accused of being a ""social butterfly."" i have more guy friends than girl friends although i get along with girls just fine. i like people but i must admit i am lazy...so i usually have one close girlfriend who is outgoing which saves me the trouble of meeting people.<br /> <br /> &amp; finally....bad stuff i have never been accused of:<br /> <br /> being mean rude or improperly dressed for any occasion<br /> <br /> if a cashier gives me too much change i return it. if random groceries are tossed into the aisle i pick them up and re-shelve them. i'm always sweet to wait staff and tend to over-tip more often than not. i'm polite to homeless people even if i have no change to spare. if that is weird or silly to you we wouldn't get along;)",likes both

"i have attempted to abstain from frequenting this digital parlour<br /> in the past but i inevitably find myself wandering its many<br /> disappointing corridors of broken hearts and forlorn glances if<br /> only to deepen the wounds upon my heart from when i last came to<br /> the okcupid.<br /> <br /> 'tis a tragic story if you wish to humor this lady's tale.<br /> <br /> it began in the summer of 1894 where edward norton still ruled san<br /> francisco and tea time was not disrespected as it is today. in<br /> fact twas the best year for tea times before sir rutherman iii<br /> took that nasty fall involving the tribals and the oriental ghost<br /> upon the bungalow in paris in the february of '95 and sir gahveryly<br /> took over and popularized all those ghastly reforms. but i digress.<br /> i was dallying the pages of the okcupid admiring the sights (as<br /> much as a fine lady can admire the mish mash of cads hooligans<br /> and boorish louts) when a gentleman called upon my doorstep<br /> leaving a telegram of awkward proposals and a date upon a zeppelin.<br /> although awkward and fumbling i was none too offended by his<br /> demeanor nor did he completely lack of charm so we arranged to<br /> meet by zeppelin on the saturday of the week.<br /> <br /> we met upon the zeppelin admired the peaks and valleys of san<br /> francisco drank tea and discussed the current policies put forth<br /> by edward norton recently concerning kittens and galvanic<br /> equipment. things were rather tepid for the most part my gentleman<br /> companion some paul v brown or somesuch until a vicious sky<br /> pirate came upon us! using his air dirigible his motley crew<br /> raided our luxury craft and went about looting and stealing all<br /> they could get their grubby hands on.<br /> <br /> oh! but the captain! that captain of the ship! how dashing he was!<br /> unlike the filthy curs going every which way laying their grubby<br /> hands on any treasure he stood above them like some beautiful<br /> marble david as if the world were some mighty goliath he just<br /> slain. whether it be confidence or arrogance smitten across his<br /> face i knew that his soul was forever smitten upon my heart. some<br /> such reason could be why my mouth spoke these words before i could<br /> even stop myself:<br /> <br /> ""oh pirate! you can plunder the gold steal the treasures ransack<br /> the reserves! but i will not be satisfied unless you whisk me away<br /> upon your mighty vessel!""<br /> <br /> i instantly covered my mouth and moved back to hide. but 'twas too<br /> late; his gaze met mine and he slowly walked with swagger and<br /> glamour towards me. i could do nothing i was paralyzed my heart<br /> was pounding out of passion or fear i knew not but my gentleman was<br /> absolutely terrified. ""back scoundrel!"" he shouted as he drew his<br /> rapier but the pirate king merely slapped it aside with nary a<br /> thought then lay a good left hook across his face. while impressed<br /> by my friend's momentary courage i swooned at the pirate;s<br /> virility. soon i was in his arms and whisked back upon his<br /> airship.<br /> <br /> i joined the pirate king on his many voyages across the sky for<br /> several months as a impassioned companion and partner in crime. we<br /> raided we loved we sang and drank and ate and he made sure not<br /> another pirate layed even a finger upon me. while surrounded by<br /> dogs he was more of a gentleman than any mainland ponce. something<br /> though always pried in the back of my mind a worm of doubt that<br /> wriggled through the apple of my paradise. for you see at least<br /> once a day my pirate king would disappear for perhaps an hour or<br /> two on end every day unable to be found anywhere i could get to<br /> upon the ship.<br /> <br /> one day when we were to have tea upon the poop deck of the ship<br /> he was absent. i inquired around the ship for his presence but none<br /> knew where he was. so i pilfered the desk at our quarters (being<br /> now a pirate queen i have learned a little of loose moralities)<br /> and found upon a hidden drawer a key to the hold that i've never<br /> seen before. there was one chamber in the hold that was perpetually<br /> locked; while perplexing i knew not to push my curiosities too far.<br /> but however on this day my instincts told me that i must discover<br /> what was behind that door. so down i went putting key to lock and<br /> discovering what lay behind the forbidden door...<br /> <br /> oh the shock! the horror! there was paul v green or somesuch there<br /> clad in the most revealing and unusual of black leather garment<br /> and my dear pirate king bent over like some serf licking his boots!<br /> i almost didn't recognize my dear as he had on some horrendous<br /> leather mask but i could tell from the depths of the eyes behind it<br /> that it was indeed my love my companion scoundrel ruler. for i was<br /> not the only one stolen from the zeppelin on that fateful day but<br /> so was my gentleman caller! and there he was partaking in some<br /> horrid ritual of servitude and utter debauchery! i left tears<br /> streaming down my eyes and a virulent mixture of rage and bitter<br /> betrayal brewing a toxic concoction upon my soul.<br /> <br /> i stole a life ship and as much loot as i could sneak off that<br /> night. i made a new name and a new life. i returned to the annals<br /> of the okcupid. but lo and behold on my return to society i<br /> discovered the profile of the very same pirate king upon my<br /> okcupid who in fact showed up as a ""similar user"" to the paul<br /> whatshisname! similar except he was marked as ""more kinky"" and<br /> marked as ""bi"" and ""available""! oh the shame i felt! to be turned<br /> aside in favor of a kink-gaylord-fancy-nancy! my heart has been<br /> irreparable to this day which is why i have cast off from the<br /> harbor of okcupid to set sail and swear off the lands of love and<br /> caring forever.",likes both

well i'm going to do something here and be completely honest about something i've never been completely honest about before. i'm sure that it's a terrible idea and that in the end i'm going to regret it but here goes anyways.<br /> <br /> ever since i was little i've always been interested in crossdressing.<br /> <br /> okay yes i know weird. it really doesn't mesh with any other aspect of my personality. if anyone who knows me ever happens to read this i'm sure i'll never hear the end of it.<br /> <br /> but it won't go away. for years (literally) i've done my best to just kind of ignore it hoping it would just up and leave me alone. i've had little outbursts where i could sort of express it in limited doses and after these doses all urges would disappear for about a week before coming back full force later on. so since ignoring it has done absolutely nothing but make it worse i'm trying out a new strategy. einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results. well i figure i'm insane enough at this point so i might as well go in the opposite direction.<br /> <br /> so here i am. i guess i should sort of clarify a bit. i don't want to be a girl i'm just a boy who likes girls clothes. i'm not particularly feminine and i'm not flamboyant in the least so it's hard to justify to people that know me.<br /> <br /> also it's hard to justify to myself considering my own personality. i'm a fighter at heart. i love conflict and i love pitting myself against other people be it in actual physical contests or in debates or other such arenas. these urges go against pretty much everything i am or so i tell myself.<br /> <br /> despite all this i might as well try it and see what happens. i would like to meet people who either are interested in the same or who just like people like me. my ideal boyfriend would probably like me doing it who might even push me to do it but isn't interested in doing it himself. i'm completely new to it. i've never dressed up and gone out in any seriousness i don't have any clothes and i don't really know where to start.<br /> <br /> the reason i'm even putting this on here is that i don't think it's very fair of me to not have any mention of it on such a personal website as this where i may possibly meet a guy that i could end up dating. and who knows maybe someone is out there just as crazy as me and actually likes it or finds it attractive. i figure it's san francisco i'm sure there are all types here.,likes cats

"i'm a top. ok ok how about 25 random things i'm not too embarrassed to admit:<br /> <br /> 1. i've hung out on separate occasions with two different members of the village people. several years ago i had the pleasure of spending the afternoon with filipe rose (the indian) during san francisco's pride celebration. years later after attending a 'very merry disco christmas' at the castro theater i got the opportunity to hang out with randy jones (the cowboy) who was both incredibly sweet and very personable. to this day ""can't stop the music"" remains one of my favorite movies of all time. i feel fortunate i was able to see the original village people perform in concert in vancouver many moons ago.<br /> <br /> 2. i played baby garfield in an elementary school musical production. i even had a solo singing part! i don't remember much about the experience except i rather over-acted through the whole thing. it would be the end of my acting career.<br /> <br /> 3. i love horror movies! i can watch the most gory stomach-turning films without having nightmares and yet i have arachnophobia. if you want to see me lose it watch arachnophobia with me one night and watch me freak out. i can't stand spiders.<br /> <br /> 4. i am a total kid at heart. i can spend hours in novelty gift and toy stores. i still love to go to amusement parks and ride roller coasters.<br /> <br /> 5. i dream of one day owning a modern home like something out of the pages of dwell. the design within reach catalog is my idea of porn.<br /> <br /> 6. when i was a child my brother and sisters told me i was adopted and made me cry.<br /> <br /> 7. my feelings are hurt easily.<br /> <br /> 8. i am addicted to reality tv. i can't get enough of it. i love it all--project runway real housewives america's next top model top chef american idol celebrity apprentice wife swap survivor--you name it. if it's reality tv chances are i've got a season pass on my tivo.<br /> <br /> 9. i love the 80s!--the music the movies the fashion. i still love watching reruns of degrassi junior high and get excited watching a good john hughes film. sixteen candles the breakfast club and pretty in pink are my coming-of-age movies. i'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to see some of my favorite artists in concert over the past few years: human league duran duran abc howard jones dead or alive berlin pet shop boys erasure.<br /> <br /> 10. i used to go out dancing in the most embarrassing outfits when i was younger. the pice de rsistance was going out clubbing in a jockstrap with a pair of bare-assed chaps in the middle of a snowstorm. to this day i wonder what on earth i was thinking.<br /> <br /> 11. i don't want to grow up.<br /> <br /> 12. i still get excited when i find out bananarama are releasing a new single.<br /> <br /> 13. my mother once made me order her the flowbee an electric powered vacuum attachment made for cutting hair. to my horror i actually ordered it but fortunately it never arrived.<br /> <br /> 14. i was upset when wham split up.<br /> <br /> 15. when i was 19 i drank an entire bottle of red wine before a night out dancing. before i could make it to the club i proceeded to throw up in my best friend's car. i am thankful she forgave me. and to my brother who had to clean up the mess. those white denim jeans would never be the same.<br /> <br /> 16. i still enjoy watching cartoons. i believe that sid &amp; marty krofft and pee wee herman are underrated geniuses.<br /> <br /> 17. i get lost easily. it's painfully embarrassing. i have no sense of direction and am usually clueless to my whereabouts. i read maps upside-down.<br /> <br /> 18. i have no idea what i am doing with my life and that terrifies me.<br /> <br /> 19. i have a brother a year older than myself who many people mistake for my twin. we look alike sound alike and act alike. we are so similar but completely different.<br /> <br /> 20. i once went to a triple feature of rollerboogie xanadu and skatetown usa. it was one of the best nights of my life.<br /> <br /> 21. i do not cook. everything i eat is either frozen boiled canned or takeout. tragic.<br /> <br /> 22. i miss living in vancouver all the time. not a day goes by that i don't think about what it'd be like if i moved back.<br /> <br /> 23. i am secretly envious of happy couples.<br /> <br /> 24. i am afraid of dying alone.",likes both

it's been a while since i've dated anyone seriously partly due to living in 7 cities in 2 countries in the last 8 years --- and partly due to being pre-occupied with my career. i've got a fantastic life and am now looking for someone to enjoy (and add to) my adventures. i still work damn hard though so you'll have to be patient with that...and lure me out of the office ;)<br /> <br /> how my parents have been married 40+ years... and if i or any of my friends will be able to work together and love like that in our relationships. i hope so and want to. if i do get married it'll be for the long haul. you'd have to agree too. otherwise we shouldn't get married!

if you've made it this far you have probably figured out that my honesty runs deep and here i venture even further. i originally left this out of my profile but it has become a more consistent conversation in my life i am addressing it here as well. my blood tests positive for hsv2 (genital herpes.) it has never troubled me and i have not passed it on to any of my partners that i know of but that doesn't mean it can't happen. because of this i always disclose it to potential partners and now to you as well. while on this subject i'd like to say... speak up people! even if you are clear of std's ask first before engaging in sexual conduct with someone. i am perpetually frustrated that i am the first to address this subject with intimate partners. i would love to see safe sex conversations become as common and as easy to have as asking someone what they want to eat for dinner which by the way is not a bad time to bring it up. i myself always try to slip it into conversation when people are thinking clearly and not in the heat of the moment... just sayin.<br /> <br /> on a lighter note i miss the cold sometimes so i now plan my visits to ny for christmas time instead of the summer. this also enables me plenty of opportunities for one of my favorite things... being surrounded by nature in the middle of a city alone.,likes both
