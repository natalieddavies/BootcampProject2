- they seem to be a lot more like me than most people are, more
friendly, talkative, and upbeat than usual, and less rigid,
self-absorbed, or uptight. and i have thought to myself, ""these are
my people. i feel at home with these people, like just another one
of many rather than someone who is always a little bit different.""
when it becomes clear, later, either because someone makes it
obvious or perhaps a party-goer later mentions that the reason why
people seemed different that night from how they have been since is
because just about everyone else was high before i got there, it

not long ago i was watching msnbc, where a doctor was informing
those enthused anchors of the health benefits associated with
eating your own boogers (whatever you do... do not stop reading
here). he continued to explain that the nose functions like an air
filter, and that all sorts of bacteria are often caught by our
mucus excretion. he further explained that by eating these we are
in essence giving ourselves booster shots  resulting in a more
responsive immune system. coming from a degreed professional all of
this seamed plausible (argumentum ad verecundiam- there is even a
term for it).<br />

wrong, and 'they' must be fought against. he lives in the 'house of

one day, quietly, with no warning, she said, ""will you hold
me?""<br />
and so he did, of course. his arms around her in an embrace that
fitted his body to hers. kissing her hair, eyelids, tip of nose.
asking, ""did something go wrong? did you have a scare?""<br />
she seems not to have heard, her arms around him tight,
tight.<br />
feeling against her cheek the comforting scratchiness of the wool
sweater she'd knitted him years ago. when they were newly
lovers.<br />
minutes passed. how very odd. he felt her trembling -- a deep
subterranean shuttering. he asked,<br />
""you didn't have an accident with your car, did you?"" and,<br />
""did someone threaten you?"" and, ""what is it?""<br />
still she made no reply. gripping him close.<br />
so he was having difficulty breathing. so his heartbeat quickened,
as if in the presence of danger.<br />
he said, ""darling, please, i love you - what is it?""<br />
he tried gently to push her away from him, just a bit, so that he
could see her face. for, suddenly, it seemed to him he could not
recall her face.<br />
but she was holding him tight, tight.<br />
saying, almost inaudibly, so that he felt rather than heard her
words, ""just hold me.""<br />
""yes, but -- what is it?""<br />
how many minutes of this embrace could he endure? five? ten? sixty?
one thousand? he said, bravely, ""yes. i'm here.""<br />

worked for years to stand on my own two feet, and i delight in
disconcerting people by stepping down off of pedestals.<br />
<br />
...and i haven't got the time or desire to ""fix"" you. people who
manage other people spend many hours a week fixing people, and
getting paid for it. it's fine, i enjoy it at some level - and i
seem to be good at it - ...and i want to relax when i get home, not
manage my partner, too. that doesn't mean i'm not supportive, it
means i expect you to be an adult and not think that's a dirty
word. you have to be a capable individual who makes an excellent
team member, not a half of something looking to be made whole. if i
have to be more professional at home than i do at the office, well,
let's just say that's not going to work out so well...<br />

roommate any more. though not due to the fat comments. new roommate
is a tall guy, who calling fat doesn't have an effect on. update 4:
new roommates all together. one of them is a good friend and we eat
things that are terrible for us and refer to ourselves as the fat

"<em>20 snippets about me, in no particular order:</em><br />
1) i am dutch-indonesian. i was born in holland, raised in
amsterdam.<br />
2) my native tongue &amp; passport are both dutch.<br />
3) i don't think i will ever give up my passport, even though the
dutch don't allow dual citizenship.<br />
4) i moved to california before i turned 18, which is why i have
never voted in my life.<br />
5) my mother and i moved to the us to start a new life, away from
my father. my father is a bad man, and by that i don't mean
bad-ass. we chose the bay area, because we picked a place on the
map where neither one of us had been to before.<br />
6) my mother moved back to holland 10 years ago. i have no
blood-relatives here, and sometimes this really freaks me
out.<br />
7) i went to 5 high schools, in 2 countries, over a period of 2
years &amp; graduated in 3 years at the age of 16.<br />
8) i moved out when i was 16 to live with my boyfriend who was 9
years older. 3 1/2 years later, at the age of 19, i moved back home
not knowing what it was like to be single.<br />
9) i have a 17 year younger brother. 17 years is exactly one
generation. i want to get to know him.<br />
10) my hair has been purple for 12 years.<br />
for most of my life i had very long, dark, thick hair. one day i
tried to imagine myself without hair, and i <em>couldn't</em>: the
thought of having it all gone was so frightening, i had no other
option but to shave it all off. when my hair grew back out, i dyed
it purple, and it's been purple ever since.<br />
11) i rode horses competitively for most of my life:
showjumping.<br />
i had the most incredible grey thoroughbred gelding: woody. short
for kirkwood [the mountain]. i won the junior grand national in
1990, and i actually went pro for one year. once in college, i
started to read too much philosophy &amp; i couldn't bear to put a
bit in my horse's mouth any longer; i couldn't put a saddle on him
anymore. i retired him &amp; haven't ridden since then.<br />
12) i raced cars for one year: a 1982 black 911 porsche carrera,
3.5 liter engine. whale tail. license plate: cujo35<br />
13) i rode a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=motorcycle"">motorcycle</a> for 6 years. it was my
only source of transportation during that time. and there was never
a day that went by without a close call. i miss my bike a lot,
though &amp; still have plans to get another one.<br />
14) i worked as a dom during my junior year in college. what began
as a purely anthropological and intellectual endeavor really turned
out to be a deeply emotional can of worms. the day this became
clear, i quit. i know that endeavors #12, 13 and 14 were integral
to my growth during those years. and by integral i mean that these
things were a combination of symptom, catharsis, self-discovery,
healing and, in retrospect, they are each very metaphorical. so
don't get too excited about this one ;-)<br />
15) i graduated with a 3.95 from berkeley, where i double-majored
in english and dutch literature.<br />
16) i worked as a teaching assistant for two years afterwards--i
probably graded over 2000 papers during that time.<br />
17) i received a full scholarship to pursue a phd in literature at
berkeley, but dropped out after 4 semesters. my decision to leave
academia was one of the toughest choices i have ever had to make. i
am glad i made that decision, though, as i feel that academia was
too good of a hiding place for me (see #20).<br />
18) it took me 28 years to discover the banana. i hated bananas for
the first 28 years of my life.<br />
19) i have three tattoos. the first is on my back: a phoenix. the
second on my stomach: a lotus. the third on my right arm: a muted
posthorn. the muted posthorn comes from my favorite novel, the
crying of lot 49 by thomas pynchon.<br />

aging dog was hoarse a majority of the time? or is it that home
schooling is not all it's cracked up to be? also- if the dog was
yelling enough to justify his name, can we be sure it was rabies
and not some rat poison from an annoyed neighbor? after all who
wouldn't be a little cranky after eating rat poison? i don't think
an autopsy is out of the question at this point, however i will be
really disappointed if turns out that daniel boone poisoned the
dog. certainly anyone who chooses to wear part of an animal carcass
on his head has to be a little suspect. i wonder what his slippers
were made out of? hollowed out pit bull heads? king of the wild
frontier? lord of the flies, if you ask me. this chap warrants a
closer look. yes, and one more thing about daniel boone, in the
50's he inspired boys to complement their fashion with raccoon
tails. okay, fine, but at one end of the tail there used to be a
raccoon, what happened to it? at the very least the guy was kind of
hard on mammals.<br />

left eye. early on my glasses had an enormous prism in a lower
corner. for a few years in my late teens i wore a contact in one
eye (after having the muscle in my left eye tightened big time).
currently i wear glasses only for reading.<br />
<br />
when i was around 1 1/2 my older brother (maybe 3 by then) was
standing behind me at the top of 30 concrete stairs at the bottom
of our block, i was holding dad's hand. my brother had a basketball
in hand, threw it at me. i go tumbling down the stairs. scrapes and
bruises - sure. no pain, no gain! any other effects - no obvious
ones yet....................<br />

there's an old town in maryland that has my name (different
spelling, with ""sburg"" at the end) and was put on the national
register of historic places - on my birthday (not birthdate -
different year, early 90's)! we were on vacation and saw a sign
(that mentioned the town being put on the national register) as we
drove out of town after having lunch there. and of course, i took a
picture with the sign.",likes both

expected to walk around in our homespun articles of clothing,
regardless of context - it's completely impractical and useless to
wear those mittens inside, where it's warm, but you have them
anyway just to show off! a bit of fine needlework is all it takes
to become instantly attractive and out of my league, and a lack
thereof is an immediate disqualifier. and knitting is such a huge
part of some guys' lives that they refuse to date anyone who
doesn't share the pastime. even the less prolific knitters still
expect to see me in a basic shawl or scarf. alas, i have several
hobbies and that's just not one of them; it doesn't bother me if

"here is one story..<br />
<br />
having finally decided that it was in my best interest to get back
to the states, i said farewell to my friends and acquaintances in
northern france. it had been a long 11 months of adventure and due
to my procrastination to return, i had a mere 3 days until my fixed
ticket return flight from amsterdam to san francisco.<br />
<br />
as usual, i had no money. cedric, my traveling companion for much
of that 11 months was sorry to see me go. he left me playing music
on the streets in caen. i made the usual 30 francs and hopped on
the train.... without a ticket.<br />
<br />
the train from caen to paris was a pleasant evening ride. no pesky
controller looking for tickets. paris of course was a different
story. a few days prior, a bomb had gone off in the subway and the
station was combing with military police. i chickened out on 3 of
the 4 evening bullet trains headed to amsterdam. tickets were being
checked prior to boarding which was not the usual drill. i sat
around nervously for hours until i had no choice. the last train
was boarding.<br />
<br />
i watched all the normal passengers line up, until finally the
telecom announced final boarding call. people now in a hurry. the
controllers started blowing their whistles. military police, dogs
and guns walking in their calculated patterns.<br />
<br />
it was my chance. i ran towards the train, the engines were
starting up. i was waving towards my imaginary parents when i was
stopped and asked for my ticket. ""ticket?"" i said surprised. ""oh
right, shit! it's somewhere in my bag."" i began to look through my
backpack. ""just get on!"" he said, obviously annoyed, ""we'll check
it inside, the train is leaving"".<br />
<br />
inside, i was overwhelmed with relief. i kept going until i felt i
was about in the center of the train. by the time i found a cabin,
the train had been on the move for a good 10 minutes. i choose to
sit next to a disheveled looking moroccan for strategic reasons,
knowing that the prejudice of the french would take attention away
from me. it's hard to actually evade the controllers on the bullet
trains since there are few stops where you can get on and off. this
evening was a simple matter of getting as far north as
possible.<br />
<br />
i took a nap.<br />
<br />
i was woken up to the sight and sound of 2 meaty looking
controllers making fun of the moroccan guys passport (i have to
admit it was in bad shape). my french isn't very good, but i
believe they where debating whether or not it was counterfeit. they
finally decided it was valid and turned to me. ""ticket and
passport"". i handed over my passport and told them that i was late
to the station and that my family was on somewhere with my ticket.
they were clearly not amused and talked to themselves. the bigger
of the two, leaned towards me while the other one was writing down
my passport information. ""he showed me the price of the ticket on
his calculator. ""i suspect your family also has your money?"". they
radioed in. ""there are no others corbin's on the train, come with
us.""<br />
<br />
the conversation to the operating switch was in a phrase: matter of
fact. the whistle began to blow. an announcement went over the
speakers. the train would be making an unscheduled stop. the
screeching of the wheels began. it took about 10 minutes for the
train to finally come to a halt. by that time, i had been escorted
to an exit point, a firm grip on my arm the entire time.<br />
<br />
the doors slid open and i was literally pushed out.<br />
<br />
outside, there was a beautiful midnight sky. in fact i had made it
about 2 hours north of paris and looking around quickly got the
impression that this was a quaint french ville, in the middle of
nowhere. the controllers were laughing and yelling obscenities that
made no sense. the train began to start. it's wheels straining
under the gigantic weight to build up to it's bullet speeds.<br />
<br />
i watched the momentum and noticed an interesting detail.<br />
<br />
it wasn't just the door that i was thrown out of that had opened.
all the doors had opened. i watched them pass me by. one by one,
each moving slightly faster and i felt hypnotized in a way that
only happens when you have made up your mind to do something crazy.
with a brave (and admittedly clumsy) leap.<br />
<br />
i was back in the train.<br />
<br />
it was dark and i soon realized that i was in first class. everyone
had their own cabins and i began making my way towards the back of
the train, hoping to find a place where i could blend in. i finally
made it as far as i could go. the door to second class was
locked....",likes both

one of the reasons why i'd like to find a significant other is
because i'd really like to have a guaranteed travel partner. while

confirm your experience and help you relive it. imagine seeing this
breathtaking view, worried that your camera will never do it
justice, knowing your words will also fall short when trying to
describe this awesome view to someone who's not there, it's
comforting to know that there's at least one other person in the

time..."" and they can say, ""yea... that was incredible"". ahhhhhh...

random comic books of mine he'd found was an object i instantly
recognized-the autograph book all fifth grade students of the

documents of my youth b) my pop has moved so many times since then

never mentioned seeing it. just weird. he didn't mention its
inclusion in the little package he sent, either. in reading it i
guess i was kind of surprised that i was able to immediately recall
most of the kids who had written in it. there were all kinds of
silly traditions as to what you were supposed to write, like this
little couplet by samuel grimsby, a quiet dark-haired athletic boy

married and live in a shack, give me a picture of each little
brat. thank you, samuel. good lordy, i just have to take a minute

you're actually reading this) and i am listening to the fleet foxes
on his itunes, their self-titled album, and they are ripping my

each page and most important of all was who you got to sign the
sixteenth page of your book because that's the person you are gonna
marry! oh yes, for reals! so without being too much of a crybaby
about it i will just say that there was no way any girl was going
to sign my sixteenth page so-beware!!! patheticness alert!!!! -i
actually got this really sweet girlnamed jennie page to sign a page

denmark, blah, blah, blah... really outing myself a bit much here,
huh?<br />
<br />
i've lived with a call girl, look, what, i was like 21 or
something.<br />
<br />
during my senior year of high school, i would wear <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=ad%26amp%3bd"">ad&amp;d</a> shirts to school
while listening to <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=militant+black+hip-hop"">militant black hip-hop</a>
music (paris, represent). this was also the year that i convinced
two friends to wear upside down <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=pentagrams"">pentagrams</a> on their foreheads to
spanish... you know, because our teacher's husband was a preacher
and she talked about the <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=jebus"">jebus</a> all the time.<br />
<br />
i've been <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=arrested"">arrested</a> for ""use of fighting words""
(well that and criminal trespass and two counts of resisting
arrest). a large group of people <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=chanting+your+name"">chanting your name</a> while
being arrested is probably not helpful (there's <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=actual+video+footage"">actual video footage</a>
of the arrest portion where i decided to smartly kick the <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=police+van"">police van</a>). especially
if you are so <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=drunk"">drunk</a>
that when you wake up in jail the guy next to you reads the rap
sheet taped to your chest and says, ""you a crazeeeee white boy"".
eventually all charges were dropped even after i failed to write my
book report on <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=jonathan%0alivingston+seagull"">jonathan livingston
seagull</a> (not making this up). also, screw you, i was like, uh
22 or something.<br />
<br />
i used to be a computer hacker. no. really. a google search for
""y-windoze"" will bring up some rather painful lameness from my
youth.<br />
<br />
in the early 90s i also helped create and write an influential
ezine. the quality was terrible. the issues were never spell
checked and included horrible english, elitism, sexism, angst and
complete non-sequitors or stories that mattered to a very small
group of people. how it ever became influential in any sort of
fashion still amazes me given the shite quality.<br />
<br />
i've never been <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=legally+deported"">legally deported</a>, yet. here's
hoping!<br />
<br />
i have this terrible habit of messaging my worst <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=enemies"">enemies</a> here on okc. the odd thing
is that a good portion of them reply. even more weird is that we
usually end up having <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=good%0aconversations"">good conversations</a>.<br />
<br />
i've quit a job and moved across country for love to <a class=
""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=a+city+i%0ahated"">a city i hated</a>
(before moving... and after (this was my fault not hers, the south
is simply not for me)). yeah, again, screw you i was like 30 or
something (even knowing the ultimate result i'd do it all
again.<br />
<br />
sometimes i'm way too much of a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=hopeless+romantic"">hopeless romantic</a>).<br />
<br />
that i'm not feeling very private right now.<br />
<br />
if you search for ""porovaara"" online and the page isn't in finnish
it is probably related to me.<br />

i had this huge crush on a girl in 3rd grade. her arms were a bit

dimples. (no, that's not my 'set type'--i don't really have a 'set
type')<br />

anyway, we were supposed to write down praises for our fellow
students, and when it was her turn, i wrote that she was ""wierd
[sic]"". several boys followed my example. i was annoyed that they
also thought she was the most amazing girl in the world, but hey,
she was special.<br />

articulate that i meant that she was ""good weird, like, weird in a

the highest compliment i could, i had become the head of the group
of mean bullies (for only this incident). detentions ensued. i was

nothing's really all that private with me; i know many people say
this, but i really *am* an open book. i'll tell just about anyone
nearly anything they want to know, as long as it's not a confidence
i'm keeping for someone else...<br />
<br />
but for the sake of this question, let's say the following:<br />
<br />
i love ellipses...<br />
<br />
i am a sappy, sentimental person at times - songs or movies can
sometimes make me cry, i can't stand to see animals that have been
run over on the road, and so on.<br />
<br />
i was badly bullied as a child, then got big &amp; strong - i hate
bullies. it delights me to make them go ""squish"" - something which,
despite my age &amp; health issues, i am still quite capable of,
given any legally-acceptable justification.<br />
<br />
i tend to be a lot of women's best guy friend - what i need to find
are women who find that sexy, rather than those who think it means
they *can't* be sexual with you. after all, if you can't do your
friends, who are you supposed to have sex with - your
*enemies*?!?<br />
<br />
mind, this doesn't mean i ~object~ to more female
""just-friends""-type-people - they're just not what i'm primarily
*looking for* on this site. but if i find one (or more), that's
cool too!<br />
<br />
i have occasionally been called ""culturally queer,"" because i have
a lot of stereotypically gay perspectives/attitudes/behaviors on
some things, but no sexual interest in guys (this is a variation on
the term ""culturally jewish"" - which also applies to me, on my
father's side - for people of jewish descent &amp; cultural
referents, but who are not members of the jewish religion). lots of
glbt friends. see also: ""the world's queerest straight guy.""<br />

my wife has other sweeties, from dear friends to occasional ""pure
fun"" playmates, and i hope to be able to say the same. she will be
more than happy to tell you this herself - we have no secrets, and
nobody is being lied to or cheated on. you can find her here on okc

i am highly <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=sex-positive"">sex-positive</a>; i think a lot of our
society's problems would be much relieved if we had a more
universally approving view of all consensual sexuality, regardless
of the number, genders, or kinks of the people involved.<br />
<br />
i used to cater the snack table at 2 regular-ish bay area sex
parties; sadly, one of them has gone the way of the dodo, while the
other is on indefinite hiatus, though they do plan to return.
relative to which, i/we are always looking for more ""adult fun""
parties to attend, especially if they take work-trade or have a
""nobody turned away for lack of funds"" policy (we're not
cheapskates, we're just *poor*). must be welcoming to all
respectful people (little or no size/age/gender/sexual
preference/kink limits).<br />
<br />
i am mildly/moderately kinky (a submissive-preferent switch, for
those who know what that means), but definitely *not* into heavy
pain (for myself, that is - if *you* like pain, tell me what you
like &amp; i'll do my level best to accommodate you; though i have
no sadistic need to do so, i do have a deep desire to make my

one last pass at a particularly unruly patch of pubes, the plastic
size-attachment doohickey that snaps onto the blades of the
clippers slipped off mid-swipe, unbeknownst to me, of course, and
before i knew what was happening i had gouged an inch-wide hairless
ravine right down the middle of my downtown grassy knoll! basically
a crotch-mohawk, in reverse! since i couldn't very well leave
things as they were, i proceeded to closely clip all vestiges of
remaining hair from the area and was left sporting the

my semi-adopted sister lives with me, in my egregiously cluttered
and dusty house. i'm a bad homeowner - completely unhandy. we hang
out sometimes, not romantically; if that's not okay, it's probably
better not to mess with me.<br />
<br />
i have a decent job and i'm very stable - more than 25 years at the
same place - but i'm not great with money and i don't feel
well-to-do.<br />
<br />
i tend to be oriented toward doing stuff for others rather more
than for myself.<br />
<br />
as of march 2011, i'm truly single - not seeing anybody at all -
for the first time in 20 years. i'm in no hurry to dive into a
marriage-track relationship. i'm not looking to just tomcat around,
and i'm certainly open to eventual monogamous committed
relationship, but i don't want to live in your pocket or have you
in mine.<br />

i went out to the basura sagrada on the night of the burn with a
friend. i had had a really hard year - working through a divorce,
an old burner lover died of an overdose, laid off from my job, a
close artistic partner had died randomly out of the blue... and
here i was at the temple reflecting on all that.<br />
i had done a tarot reading for myself recently which is generally
pretty accurate and the general reading was that i was going to
manage and balance things very well. except up there, on the temple
i didn't feel like it all. i didn't feel strong and adaptable. i
felt alone and broken down. not sure about my future. just too much
random shit happening throughout my life. so many dead friends too
young, no security, love just not working out. not like i wanted to
throw a pity party for myself, it was just all coming to head right
there. and so i'm sitting on the upper level of the temple in
ridiculously high winds and the whole structure is shaking and the
pieces of junk that the construction team has nailed to the frame
are all rattling and waving and suddenly it hits me.<br />
i'm as strong as the temple. you can take pieces of junk, things
that other people have thrown away and discarded, and turn them
into something beautiful. the wind can blow as hard as it likes,

but also because there are 50 thousand people out here right now
who have put their belief, their spirit right into this thing. yes,

"one of my earliest memories - certainly the earliest that i can
easily recall - is of being nearly 4 years old at the first house i
lived in on park street in new iberia. i was sitting at the kitchen
table to a dinner of grits and eggs. i know that grits and eggs is
typically considered breakfast food, but i grew up in a household
where breakfast wasn't just the most important meal of the day; it
was my favorite. so i ate it at every meal.<br />
<br />
i was pushing 4 and yearning for independence, so i wanted to eat
all by myself, and with a fork. my dad was fine with that, but he
had to stand over me while i ate - just to make sure that i didn't
puncture my tonsils with the newly-weaponized eating utensil.<br />
<br />
this happened around 1983 back when parents weren't so cautious
about exposing their kids to second-hand smoke. my parents happened
to be smokers and my dad stood over me while i ate my... brinner(?)
with a cigarette dangling from his lips. then the unthinkable
happened. a long chunk of cigarette ash fell from his cigarette and
right into the center of my plate. as a child, i took food very
seriously. when pleased with a meal i was known to hum and wiggle
my toes. when displeased, i would do precisely what i did when my
dad's disgusting cigarette ashes plopped into my meal: i wailed
like a baby.<br />
<br />
my dad didn't know what to do. three kids, 3.5 years of fatherhood,
and never had he unintentionally inspired that much unhappiness.
not knowing what else to do, and seeking to immediately alleviate
the situation, he grabbed a fork, spooned up the heap of grits with
the offending ashes, and ate it. ""see? it's ok to eat!""<br />
<br />
i'm not sure that i've cried harder since that moment.<br />

now cigarette ashes really freak me out.<br />

the true gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will

all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his
poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his
inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity
compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe
before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who
speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose
deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of
others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a

"""out beyond ideas of right-doing and wrong-doing, there is a field.
i'll meet you there.""<br />
<br />
this beautiful rumi quote sums up my approach to relationship
pretty well.<br />
<br />
i believe if two people are able to communicate deeply, from a
place of non-judgment and non-blame, they can almost always find
empathy for each other. even if they disagree, it's possible, in my
experience, to come to a deep understanding of each other that
builds respect and connection over time.<br />
<br />
my early relationships, including my long-ago marriage, were in
what i consider a conventional relationship model -- we enjoyed the
good and didn't effectively deal with the problems, irritants and
judgments that inevitably cropped up. as long as the good exceeded
the bad, we were okay. but by leaving the weeds untended, they
eventually overtook the garden.<br />
<br />
most relationships seem to work like this, with or without the
divorce... which is why i'd rather be single than in most
relationships i've seen....<br />
<br />
i need a partner who is committed to actively nurturing the
relationship. communicating about issues is not the dominant part
of the relationship -- what would be the point? -- but tending the
garden is a priority for me.<br />
<br />
to create an emotionally transparent relationship, a compatible
fellow would need to know his own emotional landscape and be
committed to compassionately and non-judgmentally working through

marriage to a woman that ended in october. it was pretty insular,
and very monogamous, but may have been the most positive, peaceful
and healthy end to a marriage in history. we're still great
friends. but it took a lot of energy and attention, and though i
have lived in the bay for just over two years now, there is so very
much that i haven't experienced in this dynamic area and so few
people that i know. so i am doing perhaps a radical thing on this
site... looking for awesome friends, folks who want to go have fun,
adventure around, be creative and eat amazing food. i'm no longer
looking for lovers, but if you wouldn't mind having someone in your
life who is incredibly honest, fun, kind, affectionate, positive,
who will see and point out the best in you, and could even be your
wing lady, i'm perfect for that. give it a shot. let me know some
adventure you've been dying to try; i'll probably be up for it. and
remember  you may have been having hard luck on this site, or
maybe you haven't, but i bet you're awesome and it's just a matter
of time, and timing. hugs...",likes both

<br />
i believe that our purpose here on earth is to learn how to observe
and control your own mind (not other peoples minds) and to become
more in-tune with synchronicity. i believe that dreams are tool for
becoming more in-tune with synchronicity and are very
important.<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
synchronicity is the experience of two or more events that are
apparently causally unrelated or unlikely to occur together by
chance, yet are experienced as occurring together in a meaningful
manner. the concept of synchronicity was first described in this
terminology by carl gustav jung, a swiss psychologist, in the
1920s.[1]<br />
<br />
the concept does not question, or compete with, the notion of
causality. instead it maintains that, just as events may be grouped
by cause, they may also be grouped by meaning. a grouping of events
by meaning need not have an explanation in terms of cause and
effect.<br />

ones<br />
after mrs. garrett remarried and joined the peace corps? i
mean,<br />
nobody really liked beverly anyway, so i understand if you
stopped<br />
watching after that point. the show almost lost it for me
when<br />
edna's edibles burned down and they replaced it with over our<br />
heads. i mean, that store was way too 80s retro for me and it
was<br />
1985 at the time. neon and glass block everywhere? c'mon.<br />

by the way, it did demand another 1,000 characters, so i'm
just<br />
going to keep talking about 80s tv shows. alf was another one.
i<br />
haven't seen all of <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=alf"">alf</a>, but i did see quite a bit. in
high<br />
school, we were supposed to write a speech about the most
important<br />
moment in our lives. most people wrote about their dog dying
or<br />
their grandmother dying. there was a lot of death. i,
however,<br />
wasn't about to stand in front of the class and expose my
personal<br />
life to the ridicule of backwoods pennsylvania mouth breathers.
i<br />
did my speech on the cancellation of alf.<br />
<br />
you see, alf was canceled in the middle of a two-part episode.
the<br />
government finally found alf and, in the last moments of the
last<br />
episode, they showed up at his door. to be continued. but no,
it<br />
was canceled. i got up in front of the class and told how
this<br />
moment taught me that there was no permanence in life. all
things<br />
ended, even alf. even when i was in the middle of an episode.<br />
<br />
i have also not seen the made for tv movie reunion of alf. it
would<br />
just cheapen the experience, i think. the fate of <a class=""ilink""

you probably won't even notice; i didn't for the first 20 years of

i really want to be in that place with someone. that conversational
place; the place where strange conversations about random things
flow freely and inside jokes form. the place where you learn more
about yourself through talking about everything imaginable and
learn just as much about another person. to me the greatest feeling
is knowing someone and having them know you in return. really
knowing, not just a casual understanding. i can have great
conversations with strangers and people i don't know very well
(that brings a different kind of satisfaction, which has its place
too), but it isn't nearly as satisfying as feeling completely
understood by someone and becoming close as a result. for me, this
is a relationship. sure; sex is there, attraction is there, common
interest is there, but the most intricate, yet simple, aspect of a
relationship is the conversation that comes with it. the
conversation that happens while laying with your heads upside-down
and dangling off the edge of the bed, the conversation that happens
when you're half-asleep and hardly making sense, the conversation
that goes on at 3 am - when all the best ideas surface, the
conversation that happens in every setting, and the conversation
that isn't conversation at all, but silence. to be able to sit
comfortably with someone without the need to talk -when ""awkward""
silences are just silences. a lot is said in nothing - when sounds
become decipherable words that mean something to you, while nothing
to others. but i'm not in that place right now - that
conversational place - where everything is beautiful and
meaningful.",likes both

"i'm the kind of person that, if asked would probably tell you

<br />
i have genital herpes(hsv1). woah boyo is it a stigma! it has
presented me with a quit a lot of rejection and that has been
pretty, annoying and frustrating... although it has also been a
good lesson in letting go of control. hsv1 is not very hard to
protect against, but because people are not educated about it they
are sometimes afraid and so people with herpes are often ruled out
as sexual partners. truth is though about 80% of the population
have herpes somewhere on their person (genital or oral) and many of
them ether don't know or don't tell because they are afraid to be
rejected or don't care. with that percentage you may have been with
somebody that has herpes and not had the chance to say no. so if
you meet somebody like me who is honest and upfront about it and
you are interested in them , don't cross them off your to do list
right away.<br />
<br />
fyi, i got genital herpes from receiving oral sex so watch out for
cold sores. and as you can tell i'm happy to educate people about
herpes because it can be a bummer but it is not the end of the

herpes in the first place.",likes both

1. many of the most important things in my life take place in my
mind, or are a result of talking about what is taking place in my
mind. this may seem tautological, but i assure you it isn't.<br />
<br />
2. daydreaming is as necessary to my mental well-being as
sleeping.<br />
<br />
3. i will not respect you if you are not both able and willing to
face yourself on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
4. i am 99% sure i don't want kids. ever. if you know you want
kids, we probably shouldn't date. i also don't, at this point, want
to be involved with your already-existing kids. if you have kids,
know that i will not be interested in dating you. no offense; i'm
sure they're lovely.<br />
<br />
5. i go through phases with this profile where i modify my
self-descriptions to reflect a greater or lesser degree of
straight-up bitchiness. i am actually a pretty kind, compassionate,
and considerate person to have as a friend, and my bitchiness comes
out only when you've crossed me. it's good, too, for keeping
sleazeballs away. if you are not a sleazeball, and you meet my
other criteria for emotional and analytical intelligence, i promise
i won't bite (in the figurative sense). (ugh, i know, i know, such
a lame joke, but i try to be precise with my words, and the fact is
that i might bite you someday.)<br />
<br />
6. i have a thing about spelling and grammar. (did i mention that
i'm an editorial assistant? i love it.) this gets under some
people's skin the way that incorrectly implemented apostrophes get

i'm definitely not the party type, nor would you typically find me
at a bar. this excludes occasionally going to happy hour with
coworkers and civilized get togethers or quality time with friends
or family.<br />
<br />
i care about having my life together and building love and
companionship on a solid and practical foundation. i believe a
positive contribution to society starts at home. my emotional and
financial support and my unconditional love for my future wife and
kids (and even our parents) are most important qualities i could
bring. i hope to find someone who has similar qualities and
appreciates the mutual support.<br />

salon in paris or the factory in new york.<br />

now, that just makes me tired. i could care less if you're cool. it
is important, for the sake of feeling understood, that the man i
date has what i call ""poet's eyes,"" something like amelie's view of
the world. he can be delighted by the feeling of sticking his hand
in a barrel grains, or will describe to me the overwhelming hue of
the blue flowers he saw on a hike.<br />

i want to date a man who assumes he likes people, who can look at
someone who is very different than he is, and see the common thread
of humanity, something to empathize and connect with. i have a bit
of a dark, cynical streak, but i am honestly over snark, even
inside myself. i am not over ranting about politics, though.<br />

what's most important to me, at this stage in my life, is finding a
partner. i do want a serious boyfriend, and i would like to get
married. i have to figure out pretty quickly whether i want to make
babies, and i don't like it, but that's the biological truth. what
i'm looking for in a husband/life partner/potential baby daddy is
someone who will share with cooking and chores equally, and create
a space where we offer each other mutual support as well as fun,
romance, and adventure.<br />
<br />
i'm not entirely convinced this is the place to find that sort of
partner. my heart is still healing from the last time i fell in
love, and i've been through a tremendous amount of upheaval in the
past two years. right now, i need to spend time alone, or with my
friends, to put my life back together and make sure i'm building

"have you ever noticed how ""private"" is relative? some people will

said, in the interest of fulfilling the purpose of this
poorly-worded question, story time:<br />
<br />
once i kissed someone whose name i don't remember, just because he
asked me nicely. i hadn't told him my correct name, and i ended up
checking the oil in my pickup myself (which was what i told him he
had to do for the kiss), but i kissed him anyway. i still remember
the cool softness of his lips and the lingering sweet-spicy taste
of his clove cigarette. he tried to talk me out of reapplying my
lipstick quite so soon, but when i did it anyway he held his
peace.<br />
<br />
i like that in a person. i generally respond well to people who are
willing to ask for what they want, plainly but with no
expectations, and then accept when i give all i'm willing to up
front and draw the line. push and push back is good, and
persistence is a virtue, but there is a definite limit to that when
boundaries have been clearly defined.<br />
<br />
and...<br />
there is a candle in my window for someone i've never met, but the
person who can answer it is a very rare sort, and may not even
exist. i'm comfortable with this. someday, it would be nice to find
a real partner, one who understands me and unconsciously speaks the
same language of love, who loves the way sharing enriches the lives
of all involved but will give me priority, whom i can engage with
in the dance of love and life, who will support and uplift and work
with me as much as i do for them, with as little complaint. someone
who understands the need to love deeply, and hold each other
lightly.<br />
only once has anyone ever loved me enough to give me up and help me
go my way, and to get me to commit to a partnership, i'd need
another love that strong. i'm not sure i believe i'm blessed enough
to experience such a precious and rare thing more than once in one
lifetime.",likes dogs

"when i was 12, my brother (who was 8) and i got locked out on the
deck while my parents were away, a good 15 feet from the ground
below. so we devised a plan where he would grab a hold of the
clothesline that ran from the deck to a tree about 50 feet away.
once he'd grabbed on, the plan required that i wheel him to the
center of the line (the line was on a pulley) so that he could
gently hop on to the ground (the line dipped in the middle.)<br />

i grabbed onto our side of the line and he stepped off the deck.

"some things in life are bad<br />
they can really make you mad<br />
other things just make you swear and curse.<br />
when you're chewing on life's gristle<br />
don't grumble, give a whistle<br />
and this'll help things turn out for the best...<br />
<br />
and...always look on the bright side of life...<br />
always look on the light side of life...<br />
<br />
if life seems jolly rotten<br />
there's something you've forgotten<br />
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.<br />
when you're feeling in the dumps<br />
don't be silly chumps<br />
just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing.<br />
<br />
and...always look on the bright side of life...<br />
always look on the light side of life...<br />
<br />
for life is quite absurd<br />
and death's the final word<br />
you must always face the curtain with a bow.<br />
forget about your sin - give the audience a grin<br />
enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.<br />
<br />
so always look on the bright side of death<br />
just before you draw your terminal breath<br />

was really fortunate that i realized my problem before i had done
serious damage to myself or other people, but i do take it
seriously, as it is a serious disease if untreated. i sometimes
miss sharing a good bottle of red wine over dinner with someone
special, but i'm also very fortunate that i can be around alcohol
without it causing cravings. i'm able to enjoy the relaxed
atmosphere around people who drink socially and responsibly, so if
you drink socially and moderately, it shouldn't be a deal breaker.
you'll soon find that with me you can enjoy your wine with dinner
or a drink or two to relax without it being awkward. however, for
those who are put off by my disclosure, i won't judge you if you
move on to the next profile. we probably wouldn't have hit it off
anyway! ;)<br />
<br />
most of my friends have advised me to leave this fact about myself
out of my profile on the grounds that it's not necessary to be so
forthcoming before you really know someone, and that people might
have their own prejudices against alcoholics (recovered or not). i
used to agree. however, i've recently changed changed the way i
feel about this. on one hand, i think it is important enough to
disclose to anyone who who would consider going out with me, since
the question about drinks and why i don't drink would probably
surface early on anyway. i don't want to waste anyone's time, or
mine.<br />
<br />
the way i feel now is that the person i wish to attract is someone
for which this wouldn't be such a big deal and who would rather
respect someone who's faced adversity and turned their life around.
so we'll see what happens. if one year passes by without any
responses on this site, perhaps i'll consider deleting this. ;)",likes dogs

"once, many years ago, i was on a road trip in tibet. our first stop
was ganden monastery, a place on top of a very big hill. there were
a whole bunch of statues, lots of yak butter candles, and i had a
mala blessed for my friend. after the tour, i asked my guide if i
could go up behind the monastery and look out onto the valley
below. ""sure!"" he said. i scrambled up the rocky slope, and cast my
gaze across the himalayas. there was a tibetan family picnicking on
the other side of the mountain. the mother was peeing right there
in the open, probably because she had too much coffee that
morning.<br />
<br />
after a few minutes of that splendid vista, i decided to not keep
the driver waiting. i felt my way back down the hill, but couldn't
quite find the same path. all of a sudden, a dog came out of
nowhere and started barking at me!<br />
<br />
(now, the thing you need to know is that all monasteries in tibet
have packs of semi-feral dogs half-guarding the place. i'm not sure
exactly if they're pets, or attack dogs, or what, but they belong
to the monks and are probably somehow blessed.)<br />
<br />
anyways, this dog is barking at me. and he is
<strong>pissed</strong>. this little buddy is not going to let me
anywhere near the monastery, let alone back to my jeep on the other
side of the buildings. at first he wasn't quite sure what to do,
but he started sizing me up. circling. creeping closer. getting
louder. figuring out if i might be a good substitute for dinner.
then... my cell phone rang.<br />
<br />
""hello, tim! this is your tour guide, tili!"" (tili was born in
india. he has a very strong accent.)<br />
<br />
""yes tili, what's up?""<br />
<br />
""i am down in the barking log!"" (he is attempting to pronounce
parking lot. roll with it.)<br />
<br />
""that's excellent tili, i'll be down there in a few minutes.""<br />
<br />
(the dog is getting closer.)<br />
<br />
""no no no! i said, i am down in the parking lod. you will come meet
us, yes?""<br />
<br />
""yes tili, i'll be down there in a bit.""<br />
<br />
(the dog is sweeping closer and closer. his angry bristles just
brushed my pants leg.)<br />
<br />
""ok ok. can you find your way back?""<br />
<br />
""sure, it won't be that hard.""<br />
<br />
""ok, i will hang up now. do you need anything else?""<br />
<br />
(at this point, i realize that tili can probably see me trying to
dodge this attack animal on the mountain top. being a wise soul, i
ask the local for directions.)<br />
<br />
""tili, what do i do about the dog?""<br />
<br />
<strong>""hit it in the head with a rock!""</strong><br />
<br />
""ok!""<br />

this is my perspective with experience/people/life:<br />
<br />
this being human is a guest house.<br />
every morning a new arrival.<br />
<br />
a joy, a depression, a meanness,<br />
some momentary awareness comes<br />
as an unexpected visitor.<br />
<br />
welcome and entertain them all!<br />
even if they're a crowd of sorrows,<br />
who violently sweep your house<br />
empty of its furniture,<br />
still, treat each guest honorably.<br />
he may be clearing you out<br />
for some new delight.<br />
<br />
the dark thought, the shame, the malice,<br />
meet them at the door laughing,<br />
and invite them in.<br />
<br />
be grateful for whoever comes,<br />
because each has been sent<br />
as a guide from beyond.<br />

<br />
i lead with my heart in most situations.<br />
i am surprisingly radically open-hearted compared to most who've
grown up in u.s. culture.<br />
probably something i should not say/admit, for saying so publicly
will likely be seen by most as a faux pas, never mind doubts of
veracity.<br />
knowing oneself and speaking it, never mind where one feels they
stand in relation to others, is not something usually done in
public with strangers (save certain situational context) without
rendering suspicion, unless one is self deprecating.<br />
of course some might be drawn to exploit. frankly, its (being
openhearted and vulnerable (ie willing got be powerful)) the only
way i want to live.<br />
<br />
i am bi or pan (relate to people not to gender conditioning, and
who it is right to relate to depending on what is true, not on
pre-made ideas).<br />
<br />
i am commitment and depth oriented and poly.<br />
my ideal relationship, eventually, is a poly family of more than
2.<br />
shocked? i believe this is how most of humanity has lived for the
majority of time we have been on the planet. granted it is easiest
accomplished as an individual does their emotional and spiritual
(growth) work (and works to undue toxic cultural and familial
conditioning), but what other way is there to live (than to be
doing emotional and spiritual growth work - as opposed to carrying
this ""warring"" inside, addictions, etc to our friends, partners,
community ).<br />
<br />
until or unless the individuals for this family ""show up"", i am as
always, open to what is true (and may be even better than my
imagination).<br />
<br />
i don't believe love is what we are conditioned to believe.<br />
to me love is not desire (though desire is nice), attraction -
chemical or otherwise (though attraction can be nice), addiction,
avoidance of loneliness, possession, finding someone so we are not
""alone"" when we are old, or conditional.<br />
love is a vibration, an unconditional positive regard, not
dependent on what we get back. if we allow the things that are not
love run us, we may not do what is best for ourselves or for
others. and we may never <a class=""ilink"" href=

i screamed and ran to the entire opposite side of the house,

fine, i've decided i preferred the severe hangover as i had been
made terribly aware of my situation (said hangover) and could
process my life (sleep recovery) accordingly. the mild hangover
kept sneaking up on me every few hours, and basically ruining an
entire day. and who wants to be nauseated and sleep deprived in a
hardware store with no money? not me, that's who.<br />
<br />
i also tend to go throw phased of severe insomnia. 2 or 3 hours of

on the silverware set. my sister thinks the number 8 is a bald man,

everything is so blatant, but i can usually figure out what i
think/feel possible gender might be. that said, like most

""well...sure you can be swav, even passionate at times, but...there
are other things too. how you don't mind eating rice, fried
chicken, and tortillas for breakfast, lunch and dinner. how you
love to go off the beaten track and go where no roads appear on the
map. i love how you look at the world around you. how you see the
good in people. how you're not afraid to try something new and
strange. i love how you can stand back and laugh at what's
happening to you. no matter how much hell you're going through...i
feel safe when i'm around you. especially when in your arms...what
scares me though is...i can't imagine you not in my life.""",likes both

<br />
lullaby<br />
<br />
sleep, pretty lady, the night is enfolding you;<br />
drift, and so lightly, on crystalline streams.<br />
wrapped in its perfumes, the darkness is holding you;<br />
starlight bespangles the way of your dreams.<br />
chorus the nightingales, wistfully amorous;<br />
blessedly quiet, the blare of the day.<br />
all the sweet hours may your visions be glamorous-<br />
sleep, pretty lady, as long as you may.<br />
<br />
sleep, pretty lady, the night shall be still for you;<br />
silvered and silent, it watches you rest.<br />
each little breeze, in its eagerness, will for you<br />
murmur the melodies ancient and blest.<br />
so in the midnight does happiness capture us;<br />
morning is dim with another day's tears.<br />
give yourself sweetly to images rapturous-<br />
sleep, pretty lady, a couple of years.<br />
<br />
sleep, pretty lady, the world awaits day with you;<br />
girlish and golden, the slender young moon.<br />
grant the fond darkness its mystical way with you;<br />
morning returns to us ever too soon.<br />
roses unfold, in their loveliness, all for you;<br />
blossom the lilies for hope of your glance.<br />
when you're awake, all the men go and fall for you-<br />

patterns women deciding that they were never going to let that
happen again, and because of that, a decision is made about who the
next guy is going to be--and whether that is his nature, or not,

not that i don't trust, but it just takes me a while to determine
if someone's trustworthy and i've found that many people assume
that they have my trust right off the bat. i try to give people
more of a chance upon first meeting them, but when things start to
look serious (either in a friendship or a relationship), trust
becomes something that needs to be focused on and it just comes a
little more slowly than i wish it did.<br />
<br />
also--a promise means more to me than most people think. it's the
ultimate test of trust for me. once you understand me a bit and
really get why it's so important, if you say that you promise
something, i will put my entire trust in you following through with
your promise. if you break it, it breaks my trust, and that's not

other, if you mean secular humanism. smoking: no. drinking: rarely
or not at all. offspring: doesn't have kids but might want them or
doesn't have kids but wants them. if you want to raise children,
your reasons have more to do with children than with yourself, and
you have reasons rather than unreasoned instinct or
tradition.<br />
<br />
<em>about:</em> you love the outdoors. you are intellectual and
idealistic, and you act to make your ideals manifest. you want to
have a positive effect on the people around you. you care deeply
about verbal, musical, or visual artistry.<br />
<br />
<strong>your profile content that decreases the likelihood that i
will message you:</strong><br />
<br />
<em>my details:</em> religion: any of the theistic options.
smoking: yes. drinking: very often, often, socially. offspring:
you've left this section blank without explanation, or i can tell
from other parts of your profile that you're a traditional person
who lacks reasons for your hopes and goals.<br />
<br />
<em>about:</em> you love bar hopping and clubbing. i am attracted
to social competence, not to someone who needs to drug himself to
feel interesting and interested, receptive, relaxed, outgoing,
creative, and open-minded. you say that you're sarcastic. i am not
attracted to a derisive or passive-aggressive talk style. you're
addicted to video games. i enjoy playing them with clients to teach
them pragmatics, but i do not date or form friendships with people
who prefer to spend more time with video games than with people.
you say that you're ""simple."" there's a difference between
appreciating simplicity and being simple. appreciating nature is
different from being simple. explaining complex concepts or
performing complex tasks so well that they seem simple is different
from being simple. even when you were a single cell, you were
complex.<br />
<br />
<strong>some clarification about the ""i'm looking for""
section:</strong><br />
<br />
i am looking for long-term dating, and at first, i also checked
short-term dating as an indication of attitude more than a goal. i
can value a relationship or experience regardless of how long it
lasted if i enjoyed it and learned from it. just because an
experience has a short duration doesn't mean it wasn't real or
important. however, ""looking for"" implies an intended outcome,
which is distinct from an attitude about an unintended
outcome.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a long-term date who by definition is also a
friend. i am open to male or female friends as a separate category
from dates, and i have made some friends from a dating site whom i
never dated, when it's clear that we're not compatible for dating
(it helps if one is gay and the other is not, but that's not the
only way to clarity). however, i am not looking for the passive,
shy type of person who wants to be ""friends first,"" all the while
hoping to date me and wondering why he often remains in the friend
role. i am looking for the infinitesimal number of people who
correctly understand that ""looking for"" means looking for, and not
""telling myself i'm ok with."" i'm looking for people who know what
they want in a date and what they want in a friend and who know the
difference between them.<br />
<br />

so... a girl i know has used craigslist casual encounters to hookup
with random guys (some probably filled with all sorts of stds), and
it got me thinking about the relative response rates for women and
men posting in the w4m and m4w sections respectively. i decided to
post two fake ads: one posing as a young 19 year old girl looking
for casual sex, and another posing as a young 23 year old guy
looking for casual sex.<br />
<br />
while constructing the ads i made sure to choose pictures (no
faces) from the net which were relatively equal in attractiveness.
i was careful to write ads which matched up fairly well in terms of
what most men would want and most women would want from a casual
sex partner, although i must admit that i am much better at the
former than the latter.<br />
<br />
long story short, the w4m ad ended up receiving 150 responses in
one night from all sorts of men: some were married; a few were phd
students from stanford; many sent the e-mails from facebook linked
accounts; and quite a few were markedly more attractive than the
girl in the picture that i posted. however, the m4w ad received
<strong>no</strong> replies, save for a few fake responses meant to
phish for personal info.<br />

"i've got two, both 100% true stories with no exaggeration:<br />
1) i learned how to swim in hawaii when i was four years old. my
father, who owned a restaurant specializing in hawaiian barbecue,
flew his entire staff out to hawaii for the new year's holiday in
order to import some aloha back to the mainland. during the day,
two big hawaiian ladies would come around with their pick up truck
loaded with about twenty kids to take us all to the beach while our
parents spent the day shopping or partying or whatever. the first
day, when we got to the beach, these same two big hawaiian ladies
would drag us out into the water, telling us to hold our breath and
close our eyes before dunking us under the water. i got the hang of
it pretty quickly, and soon after you couldn't keep me out of the
water if you wanted to!<br />
<br />
2) when i was five years old, and my father's restaurant was really
hitting its stride, i asked my father for a job, both because i
wanted to help and because i wanted to make some money to buy some
toy or another. so my father folded an apron over in half, tying it
around me just under my armpits (as otherwise it would have dragged
on the ground), and handed me a washcloth, telling me to bus tables
by following the waitresses and doing or getting whatever they
needed to get the tables ready. one day, a family sits down for
lunch at a table in ""my area"" and sees me, this little
five-year-old, bussing tables. the father asks me who i am, and i
cheerfully quip, ""i'm patrick! my father owns this place!"" the
father, grinning, replies, ""oh really? do you have any
recommendations?"" ""sure,"" i said without hesitation, ""whole
suckling pig, one hundred thirty-five dollars!""",likes both

way, i like vanilla just as much. what i like best in kink is story
- this includes ""slash"" fiction based on various movies and tv
shows.<br />
<br />
many friends i knew years ago were slash authors. most were bright,
creative, fascinating women full of creative projects who enjoyed a
fannish subculture. if i like the source material i could wind up
getting into a new fandom because good friends introduced me to it.
i also enjoy tabletop role playing games and live action role
playing - again, depends on the setting. sex with story and
playacting doesn't even get into b&amp;d sometimes, but it's fun
and gives a lot of flavor to the vanilla.<br />
<br />
i play safe. this means safe words, safer practices, emergency
releases and every staging trick that can be used to make a
physically and emotionally safe encounter into an exciting roller
coaster that doesn't crash. i prefer discussing sex, sexuality,
boundaries and ideas long before a friendship gets to the point
where it could become physically sexual. to me it's not a forbidden
topic and i'm probably not shocked by anything you like even if i
don't share that taste.<br />

i'm also comfortable with open relationships and alternative
arrangements like consensual polyamory. ""consensual"" is the big
word there. i don't believe in dishonesty, jealousy or double
standards. i'd rather be real and learn to trust my partner for

<br />
whether those reasons are shallow or justified, i countdown the top
11 professionals one would be wise to steer clear of.<br />
<br />
11. sheepskin benchmonkeys<br />
sheepskin benchmonkeys, a.k.a. those type of all or nothing
academic indentured servants who owe the professor all their time
and they still believe that a phd is going to be their guarantee
somehow worth all the lack of real world success and lifestyle
including dating satisfaction that they've been postponing for
years.<br />
<br />
10. air hosts/hostesses<br />
air hosts, a.k.a flight attendants, b.k.a international players:
traveling the world gives you a lot of room to hide your dirty
laundry and a lot time to do it.<br />
<br />
9. police officers<br />
police officers are ordered to serve and protect, which, loosely
translated for those that choose to date them, means long work
hours and lots of danger. if you lack understanding, patience or
faith, you can never date a cop.<br />
<br />
8. personal trainers<br />
all day, your super-fit girlfriend/boyfriend is being admired by
men and women. trainers are motivators/teachers, and remember back
in the day when you fell in love with your teacher? now imagine
that teacher pushing your leg back for stretches while you're hot
and sweaty. sounds like a bad porno already.<br />
<br />
7. writers/bloggers<br />
your whole relationship can be an ongoing interview, and every
incident is a potential story idea. a writer's life is made up of
constant deadlines, which may interfere with the amount of
attention he or she is able to give you.<br />
<br />
6. models<br />
we're not talking about the kind who book church fashion shows...
they're safe. however, if you are dating a person who makes the
runway and photo shoots their career, you have to be insanely
secure and confident. anything less will make you miss out on the
bliss of dating a model in the first place.<br />
<br />
5. bartenders<br />
bartenders make money off their looks, and they love attention.
mixologists have mastered the game of flirting and teasing,
conditioning them to be very insincere with their feelings even
when they don't intend to be.<br />
<br />
4. psychiatrist/psychologists/counselors<br />
it's like dating a writer, but 100 times worse. you are analyzed,
studied, examined and evaluated by someone who has been taught the
human psyche. in the middle of argument, you can never say, ""you
don't know what you're talking about!""<br />
<br />
3. professional athletes<br />
three words: away games. groupies.<br />
<br />
2. strippers<br />
just because t-pain fell in love with his local pole dancer and
made a song about it, doesn't mean you have to. dating either a
male or female stripper means breaking through and ignoring all the
stereotypes associated with it. you must be able to handle your
partner being adored for his/her sexuality, and them loving money
maybe more than they love you.<br />
<br />
1. unemployed<br />
this doesn't refer to those who have been laid off in rough
economic times, but those who make unemployment a full-time job,
figuring out how they can go through life without ever having to
find work. without much to occupy their time, they will become an
annoyance when all their focus is put on you, but the lack of
individual ambition is also a telltale sign of someone who won't be
participating in the growth of the relationship.",likes both

aren't there and feeling things that aren't there. my mood symptoms

someone once asked me for a list of 25 things about myself that not
everyone knew. maybe this is an appropriate place to include it...
numbered zero to 24, of course.<br />
<br />
0 - i didn't write this in facebook, i wrote it in eudora. thank
you and good evening.<br />
<br />
1 - i was aboard a virgin 747 on climbout from sfo when a bird
strike took out one of its engines.<br />
<br />
2 - if i'd got up at the right time that day, i would have been at
the wrong place at the wrong time for the manchester ira
bomb.<br />
<br />
3 - i'm partially left handed and partially right handed.<br />
<br />
4 - i get migraines if my blood sugar gets too low, hence i can't
fast.<br />
<br />
5 - i had a benign lump removed from my head when i was about
28.<br />
<br />
6 - i've never broken a bone or had stitches.<br />
<br />
7 - i like things which hypnotise me - machines, music, speed
(motion, that is, not the drug, which i haven't tried),
presentations (sometimes), going to the optician (weirdly),
etc...<br />
<br />
8 - i generally approach situations with an attitude which
approximates to ""what would make the machine work best?"",
regardless of what i'm actually dealing with.<br />
<br />
9 - i don't trust anything unless i know how it works, down to the
wire.<br />
<br />
10 - i like things that have purity of vision in their concept -
examples would be macintosh, rx-7, motm, klein, belgian beer,
etc.<br />
<br />
11 - i was allergic to duck for several years. well, i don't know
whether it was actually an allergy, but it acted like one. i
couldn't even smell it without gagging. almost like the allergy i
had to vodka for seven years following a particularly protracted
experience, but different, honest.<br />
<br />
12 - i couldn't belch until i was 33 years old. turns out it's a
genetic thing, my cousin was similarly affected.<br />
<br />
13 - i am a stickler for correct spelling and punctuation.
america's idiocratic culture is invading the world, backed up by
the military, and that's devolution and degeneration, not
evolution. we should be celebrating our languages' idiosyncratic
features, not mangling them. they will never take me alive.<br />
<br />
14 - i don't have heroes really but the closest i do have is
probably michael palin. he's normal, and a genius as well. and he
didn't call me when he came to rockridge, which nearly cost him his
almost-hero status.<br />
<br />
15 - i spent most of the time i lived in rossendale, lancashire
wishing that food came in little pills rather than shapeless
colourless blobs. since leaving rossendale, i've grown to love food
and have become a half decent cook. and of course the irony of all
this is that i can't take pills.<br />
<br />
16 - i regard most drugs as just excuses for not dealing with one's
life. of course, this does not include anything i personally like,
such as alcohol in most forms and occasional dabbling in
marijuana.<br />
<br />
17 - i had classical flute training from when i was 10 or so till -
beh, i don't remember - 14 maybe. i could play reasonably well and
was a member of various school bands and such. my lessons all ended
one day when the teacher made a mistake by thinking that we had
stopped going, when in fact we were just on holiday, and booked
someone else in our slot. my mother threw a tantrum and that was
that.<br />
<br />
18 - before i knew better, i was largely conservative. i thought
that people could make their lives whatever they wanted them to be,
regardless of their background. now i believe that our society's
most important function is to ensure that our children get the
education they deserve. blaming kids for being born into poor
families is simply selling our world's future to useless rich
people for a few lousy bucks.<br />
<br />
19 - imho, religion and intelligence are mutually exclusive.<br />
<br />
20 - i've never really had ""normal"" jobs, as people might describe
them. i've never worked as a waiter or in any retail capacity. the
closest job i had to anything like that was working in a print
finishing company, handling machines which made books and magazines
out of printed sheets. i got my first engineering job when i was
20.<br />
<br />
21 - during the time i was supposed to be paying attention at
school, i scribbled instead. i wrote a fantasy novel when i was 15,
and countless short stories etc. i even wrote crappy uninformed
porn, which my mother found while clearing out my room. i couldn't
stop myself writing.<br />
<br />
22 - i joined the lovemakers in 2002, signed a major label deal in
2004, and quit in 2006.<br />
<br />
23 - i did aids/lifecycle 7, and i'm signing up for next year.
people ask me why we do such a crazy thing, and offer various ""is
it this?"" answers. i usually answer ""all of the above"", but the
main reasons are (1) there is hiv in the family, and (2) it's such
a ridiculous thing to do that it has to be done.<br />
<br />
24 - i'm not really a proctor. i'm more of a smithies.<br />
<br />
25 - i think anything is worth doing if it's funny<br />
<br />
26 - i think life's funnier if you're crap<br />
<br />
27 - i spent my 18th birthday at a mediaeval castle in cheshire",likes both

yeses. but they always managed to fall through in the end. so
instead, i started to ask people to draw me a piano since i figured
it might be the closest i'd ever get to actually having one. at
this point i've been doing it for a number of years now and have an
amazing collection of drawn or painted pianos done on anything from
cocktail napkins to big canvases. i even have one painted on a
skateboard. and they've come from so many different people from
around the world, from friends to random strangers at the bar or on

these are the things that have been said most often over the years
to/about me...good and bad. (that's hella ""private"" wouldn't you
say? ;)<br />
<br />
first: the good stuff i can claim:<br />
i'm told i am clever, amusing - if sometimes inappropriately so -
and a good distraction after a crap day. a good friend in a crisis
(mellow + gallows humor?), with a finely-tuned sense of decorum
(i'm properly dressed for any occasion...and i won't offend your
gran.) i wear vintage day dresses, and the only time i wear sweats
is to the gym. i put makeup on to go to the store...but it only
takes me 5 minutes. i know my music and cars...and i walk awfully
fast for a girl.<br />
<br />
i've often been told i'm ""intimidating"" ...usually the context is:
""i used to have the biggest crush on you...but you were so
intimidating"" - which i have never known how to interpret, so i'll
just stick it in the 'good' column. (if that's 'guy speak' for
something bad, tell me...and i'll move it to the 'bad' column
lol)<br />
<br />
now: the good stuff i can't claim:<br />
i have never been accused of being a ""social butterfly."" i have
more guy friends than girl friends, although i get along with girls
just fine. i like people, but i must admit i am lazy...so i usually
have one close girlfriend who is outgoing, which saves me the
trouble of meeting people.<br />
<br />
&amp; finally....bad stuff i have never been accused of:<br />
<br />
being mean, rude, or improperly dressed for any occasion<br />
<br />
if a cashier gives me too much change, i return it. if random
groceries are tossed into the aisle, i pick them up and re-shelve
them. i'm always sweet to wait staff, and tend to over-tip more
often than not. i'm polite to homeless people even if i have no
change to spare. if that is weird or silly to you, we wouldn't get

the universe is a really big thing, it is beyond our complete

not fully understand them all. we are part of it, we can fight
against it or be in harmony with it. . there is no 'master
controller/god' watching/governing us, dishing out favors and
punishments. we are responsible for ourselves, our choices,
thoughts, actions, and personal search/understanding, of/for, the
truth. any person/organization claiming to be 'the one true way' is

i'm very independent, so much so that i don't innately desire a
long term relationship. i could happily spend the rest of my life
single. however, i am open to exploring a situation with the right
person if it works for both of us.<br />
<br />
my lifetime relationship ideal would be a devoted partner in crime.
i think a romantic partnership should allow opportunities for us to
add fun, support, sweetness and ease to each other's lives.<br />
<br />
i'm 99.5% women identified... but i could feasibly date a guy under
the right circumstances. the bar is set super high for that though.
i do have to leave open a little wiggle room for lenny kravitz
don't i? i think sexuality is fluid anyway, so i prefer the term
queer if i have to use a label. i like thoughtful, nurturing,
eclectic, artsy, nerdy bohemian guys. i also believe that chivalry
ain't dead.<br />
<br />
old newsflash: <a href=""http://www.celebitchy.com/8864/lenny_kravitz_celibate_i_dont_believe_it/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">
lenny kravitz is celibate while seeking a life partner</a>.
ironically, i find this pretty hawt. i've decided to take more of a
slow poke approach to dating so i can dig his decision with two
shovels. on the other hand, this could be a sign of the
apocalypse.<br />
<br />
i don't do drama. i try my best to be patient, but i have and will
gladly drop people if their presence adds drama to my life.<br />
<br />
it's not all sunshine and roses. i'll admit i tend to be a bit of
an over thinker. it probably comes from some overly perfectionist
tendencies i've been beating back into submission thanks to my yoga
and meditation practices. i can also be a rip roaringly facetious
smart ass. sometimes this tendency is misunderstood, but for some
that's simply a part of my charm. ;)<br />

"in third grade, i decided i wanted to be: a scientist, a comedian,
an inventor, a husband, and an astronaut.<br />

<br />
 oh my god i cannot be a comedian. i love to make people laugh but
i'm just not funny enough. (it's okay, we can joke about
this.)<br />
 i would still like to be a husband someday, but it's not urgent,
at all, and honestly i think my key motivation at that point was so
i could have sex  hmm, turns out you really don't need that ring
to get it on!<br />
 scientist? i suppose i turned out more like an engineer, though
hopefully i will be doing user experience research. and i do have a
scientist's worldview: skeptical, irreligious, somewhat fact-based,
willing to make and admit to mistakes, interested to learn
more.<br />
 i guess you could call me an inventor if you count web apps. i
don't think third-grade me would have. sorry, little guy.<br />
 astronaut  that dream kinda died when i realized you generally
have to go through the air force *and* have perfect physical
condition *and* get along *just fine* with a crew of people you
could be with in a supremely tiny space (again, no pun intended)
for potentially weeks (or months, if we're talking about that

called up the place where the party was, they hadn't seen it

reason, i leave it there sometimes, but not this time. so i told
them if it pops up to let me know. i called a few people who were
at the party, but they were no help either. i was starting to get
desperate. i really don't like being without my penis for too long.

a couple years back i was at a dead end job, was living with a
crazy girl, i was 40 pounds overweight, a boring and unhappy
person, had almost no friends, and was miserable feeling like i was
spinning my wheels and getting no where. so i sat down and wrote
out 13 things i wanted to change about my life. things i was
unhappy with and goals i wanted to achieve. on that day i made the
promise to myself that i will never settle for a mediocre life
again, and from then on made ""me"" the focus of my life. i quit my
job, moved from marin out to berkeley, went back to college again,
focused on foreign language studies daily, and made the decision
not to date anyone for a year so when i started dating again i'd be
more selective about who i give my time and heart to, and
throughout that year i lost 40 pounds, met many new people and made
tons of new friends, and changed my attitude on life. i truly
wanted to change my life and now i'm the happiest i've ever been.
i'm no where near the ideal man i want to be, since i don't own a
mansion and i don't have 7 cars in my driveway yet :-p jk but i'm
not stopping until i reach the pinnacle of success, with education,

can be.<br />

parlour<br />
in the past, but i inevitably find myself wandering its many<br />
disappointing corridors of broken hearts, and forlorn glances,
if<br />
only to deepen the wounds upon my heart from when i last came
to<br />
the okcupid.<br />
<br />
'tis a tragic story, if you wish to humor this lady's tale.<br />
<br />
it began in the summer of 1894, where edward norton still ruled
san<br />
francisco and tea time was not disrespected as it is today.
in<br />
fact, twas the best year for tea times, before sir rutherman
iii<br />
took that nasty fall involving the tribals and the oriental
ghost<br />
upon the bungalow in paris in the february of '95 and sir
gahveryly<br />
took over and popularized all those ghastly reforms. but i
digress.<br />
i was dallying the pages of the okcupid, admiring the sights
(as<br />
much as a fine lady can admire the mish mash of cads,
hooligans,<br />
and boorish louts), when a gentleman called upon my doorstep,<br />
leaving a telegram of awkward proposals and a date upon a
zeppelin.<br />
although awkward and fumbling i was none too offended by his<br />
demeanor, nor did he completely lack of charm, so we arranged
to<br />
meet by zeppelin on the saturday of the week.<br />
<br />
we met upon the zeppelin, admired the peaks and valleys of
san<br />
francisco, drank tea, and discussed the current policies put
forth<br />
by edward norton recently concerning kittens and galvanic<br />
equipment. things were rather tepid for the most part, my
gentleman<br />
companion, some paul v brown or somesuch, until a vicious sky<br />
pirate came upon us! using his air dirigible, his motley crew<br />
raided our luxury craft and went about looting and stealing
all<br />
they could get their grubby hands on.<br />
<br />
oh! but the captain! that captain of the ship! how dashing he
was!<br />
unlike the filthy curs going every which way laying their
grubby<br />
hands on any treasure, he stood above them like some
beautiful<br />
marble david, as if the world were some mighty goliath he
just<br />
slain. whether it be confidence or arrogance smitten across
his<br />
face, i knew that his soul was forever smitten upon my heart.
some<br />
such reason could be why my mouth spoke these words before i
could<br />
even stop myself:<br />
<br />
""oh pirate! you can plunder the gold, steal the treasures,
ransack<br />
the reserves! but i will not be satisfied unless you whisk me
away<br />
upon your mighty vessel!""<br />
<br />
i instantly covered my mouth and moved back to hide. but 'twas
too<br />
late; his gaze met mine, and he slowly walked, with swagger
and<br />
glamour towards me. i could do nothing, i was paralyzed, my
heart<br />
was pounding out of passion or fear i knew not but my gentleman
was<br />
absolutely terrified. ""back, scoundrel!"" he shouted as he drew
his<br />
rapier, but the pirate king merely slapped it aside with nary
a<br />
thought then lay a good left hook across his face. while
impressed<br />
by my friend's momentary courage, i swooned at the pirate;s<br />
virility. soon i was in his arms and whisked back upon his<br />
airship.<br />
<br />
i joined the pirate king on his many voyages across the sky
for<br />
several months as a impassioned companion and partner in crime.
we<br />
raided, we loved, we sang and drank and ate, and he made sure
not<br />
another pirate layed even a finger upon me. while surrounded
by<br />
dogs, he was more of a gentleman than any mainland ponce.
something<br />
though always pried in the back of my mind, a worm of doubt
that<br />
wriggled through the apple of my paradise. for you see, at
least<br />
once a day my pirate king would disappear for perhaps an hour
or<br />
two on end every day, unable to be found anywhere i could get
to<br />
upon the ship.<br />
<br />
one day, when we were to have tea upon the poop deck of the
ship,<br />
he was absent. i inquired around the ship for his presence but
none<br />
knew where he was. so i pilfered the desk at our quarters
(being<br />
now a pirate queen i have learned a little of loose
moralities),<br />
and found upon a hidden drawer a key to the hold that i've
never<br />
seen before. there was one chamber in the hold that was
perpetually<br />
locked; while perplexing i knew not to push my curiosities too
far.<br />
but however, on this day, my instincts told me that i must
discover<br />
what was behind that door. so down i went, putting key to lock,
and<br />
discovering what lay behind the forbidden door...<br />
<br />
oh the shock! the horror! there was paul v green or somesuch
there<br />
clad in the most revealing and unusual of black leather
garment,<br />
and my dear pirate king bent over like some serf licking his
boots!<br />
i almost didn't recognize my dear as he had on some
horrendous<br />
leather mask but i could tell from the depths of the eyes behind
it<br />
that it was indeed my love, my companion scoundrel ruler. for i
was<br />
not the only one stolen from the zeppelin on that fateful day,
but<br />
so was my gentleman caller! and there he was, partaking in
some<br />
horrid ritual of servitude and utter debauchery! i left,
tears<br />
streaming down my eyes and a virulent mixture of rage and
bitter<br />
betrayal brewing a toxic concoction upon my soul.<br />
<br />
i stole a life ship and as much loot as i could sneak off
that<br />
night. i made a new name and a new life. i returned to the
annals<br />
of the okcupid. but lo and behold, on my return to society, i<br />
discovered the profile of the very same pirate king upon my<br />
okcupid, who in fact showed up as a ""similar user"" to the
paul<br />
whatshisname! similar except he was marked as ""more kinky"",
and<br />
marked as ""bi"" and ""available""! oh, the shame i felt! to be
turned<br />
aside in favor of a kink-gaylord-fancy-nancy! my heart has
been<br />
irreparable to this day, which is why i have cast off from
the<br />
harbor of okcupid to set sail and swear off the lands of love
and<br />
caring forever.",likes both

space aliens. there is an orange tree outside the window of my
bedroom in the house where i grew up; for many years, generations
of small nocturnal rodents have been enjoying the tree and its
fruits, but i was always afraid to look because they might be space
aliens.<br />
<br />
this fear did not truly go away until my fourth year of college,
when i took a semester of astronomy. for anyone who hasn't taken
any astronomy or watched the discovery channel, i will summarize
the concept of space with some brief, sweeping generalizations:
space is huge; everything is very far apart, and although we have
developed fancy technology to see things far away in the huge
emptiness of space, in general what we have seen thus far are
really big balls of gas.<br />

"well, i'm going to do something here and be completely honest about
something i've never been completely honest about before. i'm sure
that it's a terrible idea, and that in the end i'm going to regret
it, but here goes anyways.<br />
<br />
ever since i was little, i've always been interested in
crossdressing.<br />
<br />
okay, yes, i know, weird. it really doesn't mesh with any other
aspect of my personality. if anyone who knows me ever happens to
read this, i'm sure i'll never hear the end of it.<br />
<br />
but it won't go away. for years (literally) i've done my best to
just kind of ignore it, hoping it would just up and leave me alone.
i've had little outbursts where i could sort of express it in
limited doses, and after these doses all urges would disappear for
about a week, before coming back full force later on. so since
ignoring it has done absolutely nothing but make it worse, i'm
trying out a new strategy. einstein once said that the definition
of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting
different results. well, i figure i'm insane enough at this point
so i might as well go in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
so here i am. i guess i should sort of clarify a bit. i don't want
to be a girl, i'm just a boy who likes girls clothes. i'm not
particularly feminine, and i'm not flamboyant in the least, so it's
hard to justify to people that know me.<br />
<br />
also, it's hard to justify to myself considering my own
personality. i'm a fighter at heart. i love conflict, and i love
pitting myself against other people be it in actual physical
contests, or in debates or other such arenas. these urges go
against pretty much everything i am, or so i tell myself.<br />
<br />
despite all this, i might as well try it and see what happens. i
would like to meet people who either are interested in the same, or
who just like people like me. my ideal boyfriend would probably
like me doing it, who might even push me to do it, but isn't
interested in doing it himself. i'm completely new to it. i've
never dressed up and gone out in any seriousness, i don't have any
clothes, and i don't really know where to start.<br />
<br />
the reason i'm even putting this on here is that i don't think it's
very fair of me to not have any mention of it on such a personal
website as this where i may possibly meet a guy that i could end up
dating. and who knows, maybe someone is out there just as crazy as
me, and actually likes it or finds it attractive. i figure, it's
san francisco, i'm sure there are all types here.",likes cats

"i'm a top. ok ok, how about 25 random things i'm not too
embarrassed to admit:<br />
<br />
1. i've hung out on separate occasions with two different members
of the village people. several years ago i had the pleasure of
spending the afternoon with filipe rose (the indian) during san
francisco's pride celebration. years later, after attending a 'very
merry disco christmas' at the castro theater, i got the opportunity
to hang out with randy jones (the cowboy) who was both incredibly
sweet and very personable. to this day ""can't stop the music""
remains one of my favorite movies of all time. i feel fortunate i
was able to see the original village people perform in concert in
vancouver many moons ago.<br />
<br />
2. i played baby garfield in an elementary school musical
production. i even had a solo singing part! i don't remember much
about the experience except i rather over-acted through the whole
thing. it would be the end of my acting career.<br />
<br />
3. i love horror movies! i can watch the most gory, stomach-turning
films without having nightmares and yet i have arachnophobia. if
you want to see me lose it, watch arachnophobia with me one night
and watch me freak out. i can't stand spiders.<br />
<br />
4. i am a total kid at heart. i can spend hours in novelty gift and
toy stores. i still love to go to amusement parks and ride roller
coasters.<br />
<br />
5. i dream of one day owning a modern home like something out of
the pages of dwell. the design within reach catalog is my idea of
porn.<br />
<br />
6. when i was a child my brother and sisters told me i was adopted
and made me cry.<br />
<br />
7. my feelings are hurt easily.<br />
<br />
8. i am addicted to reality tv. i can't get enough of it. i love it
all--project runway, real housewives, america's next top model, top
chef, american idol, celebrity apprentice, wife swap, survivor--you
name it. if it's reality tv, chances are i've got a season pass on
my tivo.<br />
<br />
9. i love the 80s!--the music, the movies, the fashion. i still
love watching reruns of degrassi junior high and get excited
watching a good john hughes film. sixteen candles, the breakfast
club, and pretty in pink are my coming-of-age movies. i'm thrilled
to have had the opportunity to see some of my favorite artists in
concert over the past few years: human league, duran duran, abc,
howard jones, dead or alive, berlin, pet shop boys, erasure.<br />
<br />
10. i used to go out dancing in the most embarrassing outfits when
i was younger. the pice de rsistance was going out clubbing in a
jockstrap with a pair of bare-assed chaps in the middle of a
snowstorm. to this day, i wonder what on earth i was
thinking.<br />
<br />
11. i don't want to grow up.<br />
<br />
12. i still get excited when i find out bananarama are releasing a
new single.<br />
<br />
13. my mother once made me order her the flowbee, an electric
powered vacuum attachment made for cutting hair. to my horror i
actually ordered it, but fortunately it never arrived.<br />
<br />
14. i was upset when wham split up.<br />
<br />
15. when i was 19, i drank an entire bottle of red wine before a
night out dancing. before i could make it to the club i proceeded
to throw up in my best friend's car. i am thankful she forgave me.
and to my brother who had to clean up the mess. those white denim
jeans would never be the same.<br />
<br />
16. i still enjoy watching cartoons. i believe that sid &amp; marty
krofft and pee wee herman are underrated geniuses.<br />
<br />
17. i get lost easily. it's painfully embarrassing. i have no sense
of direction and am usually clueless to my whereabouts. i read maps
upside-down.<br />
<br />
18. i have no idea what i am doing with my life and that terrifies
me.<br />
<br />
19. i have a brother a year older than myself, who many people
mistake for my twin. we look alike, sound alike, and act alike. we
are so similar but completely different.<br />
<br />
20. i once went to a triple feature of rollerboogie, xanadu, and
skatetown usa. it was one of the best nights of my life.<br />
<br />
21. i do not cook. everything i eat is either frozen, boiled,
canned, or takeout. tragic.<br />
<br />
22. i miss living in vancouver all the time. not a day goes by that
i don't think about what it'd be like if i moved back.<br />

before committing to anything- but even this open and tentative

feels like everyone wants to experience love and keep all their
options open.<br />
<br />
i was raised to understand that commitment creates it's own
opportunities, like depth, and a strong context for physical
exploration, vulnerability, growth and being oneself. so i'm
looking (eventually, and in it's own time) for a best friend and
lover to share everything beautiful, fun, difficult, and dark with.
someone to share all the things i'm grateful for with, someone to
play with, to learn from and to teach, etc.<br />
<br />
so, respectfully, i request that you check in with yourself and be
clear that you want commitment with the right person and that you
are actually ready for it. i'm also not philosophically opposed to
exploring other relationship styles and forms if they feel right,
but i feel pretty inexperienced in that area and feel pretty clear
that it's not what i want right now.<br />

would both taste even better together. so one day, i heated a bowl
of spaghetti-o's and added a few peanut butter m&amp;m's to it. i
thought it was cool how the food coloring from the candy shell was
melting into the tomato cheese sauce; the colors were really
pretty. i stuck my spoon into the peanut butter
m&amp;m's/spaghetti-o's mixture, and scooped a spoonful of it into
my mouth. it tasted fine at first, but after the candy shell
dissolved, it was one of the worst things i had ever tasted! i
really didn't want to finish my spaghetti-o's, but at the same
time, i didn't want to waste it. i reluctantly finished it, but by

this because i should've known the landscape well). i went to get
us a few beers and on my way back, i forgot about the little step
up to where we were sitting. i tripped in a spectacular fashion.
went down like you read about. beers hit the ground and so did i. i
laughed my ass off. but here's the best part  steel yourself: he
didn't even notice because he was on the phone with another woman
he met online that he was sweet on. no, i'm not kidding. you can't
make something like that up. or at least i couldn't. (we actually
ended up being friends. and i counseled him on his pursuit of said
woman. that's how i roll ...)",likes both
