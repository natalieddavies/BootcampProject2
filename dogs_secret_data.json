committing to anything- but even this open and tentative approach to intimacy doesn't seem that easy in the bay area. it feels like everyone wants to experience love and keep all their options open.<br \\/> <br \\/> i was raised to understand that commitment creates it's own opportunities like depth and a strong context for physical exploration vulnerability growth and being oneself. so i'm looking (eventually and in it's own time) for a best friend and lover to share everything beautiful fun difficult and dark with. someone to share all the things i'm grateful for with someone to play with to learn from and to teach etc.<br \\/> <br \\/> so respectfully i request that you check in with yourself and be clear that you want commitment with the right person and that you are actually ready for it. i'm also not philosophically opposed to exploring other relationship styles and forms if they feel right but i feel pretty inexperienced in that area and feel pretty clear that it's not
