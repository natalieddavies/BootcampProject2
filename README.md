# Who do you like more? Cat People... or Dog People?

After finding some online dating data from the US OKCupid, this dataset provided us with an intensive profile of individuals preferences in people. Reading through this data, we noticed that the most commonly answered question was if these individuals were "cat" or "dog" people. We havedirected our concept to typecast these "cat" or "dog" people. 

Who would you rather hang out with, a "cat" or a "dog" person? 

Questions: 
- "What can't you live without" - most commonly answered for both 
- "Tell us a secret" - most commonly answered for both
- "What is your favourite feature about yourself" - most commonly answered for both
- "What is your favourite feature in other people" - most commonly answered for both 
- Who has the higher education? 
- Multilingual?
- Most common jobs for both
- Who is the tallest? 
- Most common religion

We feel that there can be some strong visualizations with graphs comparing the two, as well as buttons for "Cat People Secrets" or "Dog People Secrets" that randomly generates a quote from the data from that field.
