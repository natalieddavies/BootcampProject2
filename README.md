# DATING APPS AND DIVORCE RATES PROJECT

# Marriages are more successful from traditional dating, rather than online dating.

In this project, we have data from the ABS Divorce Data 1998-2018. This is a good period as it demonstrates the time before online dating was as prevalent as it currently is. We defined this prevalence from the launch of Tinder in September, 2012. 

Our data includes: 
- which gender filed for divorce
- divorces by Australian state
- divorces by age group
- duration of the marriage

We hope to find the exit survery data from people deleting thier profile from popular dating apps such as Bumble, Tinder and Grindr. This survey asks for the reason why they are leaving (eg. "Have found someone", "Have not found someone). We would also like to find statistics of reactivated profiles and profile duration before deletion. It would also be interesting to find data on peoples motivation behind joining a dating app (eg. to find the love of their life, for some fun or for a friend). 


# Adjustment 01/10/2020

After having some issues finding dating data in Australia, we found some online dating data from the US OKCupid. This dataset provided us with an intensive profile of these individuals who had been asked a series of questions. Reading through this data, we noticed that the most commonly answered question was if these individuals were "cat" or "dog" people. We have now redirected our concept to typecast these "cat" or "dog" people. 

Who would you rather hang out with, a "cat" or a "dog" person? 

Questions: 
- "What can't you live without" - most commonly answered for both 
- "Tell us a secret" - most commonly answered for both
- "What is your favourite feature about yourself" - most commonly answered for both
- "What is your favourite feature in other people" - most commonly answered for both 
- Who has the higher education? 
- Multilingual?
- Most common jobs for both
- Who is the tallest? 
- Most common religion

We feel that there can be some strong visualizations with graphs comparing the two, as well as buttons for "Cat People Secrets" or "Dog People Secrets" that randomly generates a quote from the data from that field.
