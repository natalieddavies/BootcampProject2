# The Age Old Dating Question... "Are you a cat or a dog person?"

After finding some online dating data from the US OKCupid, this dataset provided us with an intensive profile of individuals preferences in people. Reading through this data, we noticed that the most commonly answered question was if these individuals were "cat" or "dog" people. We have directed our concept to typecast these "cat" or "dog" people. 

Who would you rather hang out with, a "cat" or a "dog" person?
