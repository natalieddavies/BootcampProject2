# DATING APPS AND DIVORCE RATES PROJECT

# Marriages are more successful from traditional dating, rather than online dating.

In this project, we have data from the ABS Divorce Data 1998-2018. This is a good period as it demonstrates the time before online dating was as prevalent as it currently is. We defined this prevalence from the launch of Tinder in September, 2012. 

Our data includes: 
- which gender filed for divorce
- divorces by Australian state
- divorces by age group
- duration of the marriage

We hope to find the exit survery data from people deleting thier profile from popular dating apps such as Bumble, Tinder and Grindr. This survey asks for the reason why they are leaving (eg. "Have found someone", "Have not found someone). We would also like to find statistics of reactivated profiles and profile duration before deletion. It would also be interesting to find data on peoples motivation behind joining a dating app (eg. to find the love of their life, for some fun or for a friend).
